00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:12,599
yo Elliot What's Up Guys hey we've got a

2
00:00:09,869 --> 00:00:14,939
question from our buddy Chris the shunt

00:00:12,599 --> 00:00:16,800
camp online for him he's got a young

4
00:00:14,939 --> 00:00:18,149
friend young female friend who was in a

5
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:21,240
car accident she didn't have her

6
00:00:18,149 --> 00:00:25,038
seatbelt on and it messed her up pretty

7
00:00:21,239 --> 00:00:28,259
bad he says that<font color="#CCCCCC"> she now goes to a pain</font>

8
00:00:25,039 --> 00:00:30,779
<font color="#E5E5E5">management doctor and he doesn't like</font>

9
00:00:28,260 --> 00:00:32,939
the sound of this cuz you know pain

10
00:00:30,778 --> 00:00:34,710
<font color="#E5E5E5">management often means like get addicted</font>

11
00:00:32,939 --> 00:00:38,070
<font color="#CCCCCC">to pain pills at least that's how it is</font>

12
00:00:34,710 --> 00:00:39,950
in our culture you know pain management

13
00:00:38,070 --> 00:00:42,480
means I get you addicted<font color="#E5E5E5"> to pills and</font>

14
00:00:39,950 --> 00:00:44,670
that's how you manage it<font color="#E5E5E5"> and you don't</font>

15
00:00:42,479 --> 00:00:46,558
want that for his friend because it's

16
00:00:44,670 --> 00:00:48,750
ugly I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> looking out the window here</font>

17
00:00:46,558 --> 00:00:51,259
because where my office is is and you

18
00:00:48,750 --> 00:00:56,579
see them they're<font color="#CCCCCC"> there pill addicts and</font>

19
00:00:51,259 --> 00:00:58,858
it's ugly so uh he says that although

20
00:00:56,579 --> 00:01:00,989
he's<font color="#CCCCCC"> not a doctor he does kind of sense</font>

21
00:00:58,859 --> 00:01:03,840
<font color="#E5E5E5">that she could</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> potentially get out of</font>

22
00:01:00,988 --> 00:01:05,728
all this pain granted that she begins

23
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:08,579
physical therapy stretches and exercises

24
00:01:05,728 --> 00:01:11,728
and he's<font color="#E5E5E5"> basically hoping that she could</font>

25
00:01:08,579 --> 00:01:13,739
<font color="#CCCCCC">potentially be free from pain and move</font>

26
00:01:11,728 --> 00:01:17,099
on with<font color="#E5E5E5"> her life without the pain</font>
