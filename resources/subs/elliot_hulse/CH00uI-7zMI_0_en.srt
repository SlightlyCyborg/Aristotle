1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,959
in the sport of powerlifting<font color="#E5E5E5"> an athlete</font>

2
00:00:01,889 --> 00:00:05,669
will choose<font color="#CCCCCC"> one of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> several different</font>

3
00:00:03,959 --> 00:00:07,798
movements to maximize his strength

4
00:00:05,669 --> 00:00:09,269
potential in so let's use the bench

5
00:00:07,799 --> 00:00:10,620
<font color="#E5E5E5">press for example for those you who</font>

6
00:00:09,269 --> 00:00:13,469
don't know the bench<font color="#E5E5E5"> press is an</font>

7
00:00:10,619 --> 00:00:15,599
exercise where the athlete unwraps a

8
00:00:13,468 --> 00:00:17,939
barbell loaded with a certain amount of

9
00:00:15,599 --> 00:00:21,000
<font color="#E5E5E5">weight a lot of weight enough that he</font>

10
00:00:17,940 --> 00:00:22,740
can only possibly do it once he unwraps

11
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:26,309
the weight brings it down to his chest

12
00:00:22,739 --> 00:00:29,098
and then extends it back out the entire

13
00:00:26,309 --> 00:00:31,488
sport is designed<font color="#CCCCCC"> around maximizing your</font>

14
00:00:29,099 --> 00:00:35,009
potential in that<font color="#E5E5E5"> one particular</font>

15
00:00:31,489 --> 00:00:37,620
movement so you would imagine that<font color="#E5E5E5"> as</font>

16
00:00:35,009 --> 00:00:40,710
the athlete<font color="#E5E5E5"> finds that there are some</font>

17
00:00:37,619 --> 00:00:43,349
weights that<font color="#E5E5E5"> he cannot push you know</font>

18
00:00:40,710 --> 00:00:46,079
it's too heavy what he'll start to<font color="#E5E5E5"> do is</font>

19
00:00:43,350 --> 00:00:49,140
break down the spectrum<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that movement</font>

20
00:00:46,079 --> 00:00:50,280
so once the bar leaves the chest he's

21
00:00:49,140 --> 00:00:53,128
<font color="#E5E5E5">going to recognize</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that there's a</font>

22
00:00:50,280 --> 00:00:55,980
spectrum between the chest and full

23
00:00:53,128 --> 00:00:59,608
extension and along that<font color="#E5E5E5"> spectrum there</font>

24
00:00:55,979 --> 00:01:01,788
are sticking points a really<font color="#E5E5E5"> good power</font>

25
00:00:59,609 --> 00:01:05,189
lifter<font color="#CCCCCC"> is going to do all that he can to</font>

26
00:01:01,789 --> 00:01:07,650
discover his sticking points and then

27
00:01:05,188 --> 00:01:09,839
use specific exercises to strengthen

28
00:01:07,650 --> 00:01:13,140
himself in such a fashion that those

29
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:14,670
sticking points are moved beyond so that

30
00:01:13,140 --> 00:01:17,150
ultimately when he adds more way<font color="#E5E5E5"> to the</font>

31
00:01:14,670 --> 00:01:20,609
bar he becomes stronger by<font color="#E5E5E5"> overcoming</font>

32
00:01:17,150 --> 00:01:23,460
sticking points now in your life there

33
00:01:20,609 --> 00:01:24,719

points and in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> same way that the</font>

power lifter is<font color="#E5E5E5"> very appreciative of</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">these sticking points because it</font>

develops his strength in that<font color="#E5E5E5"> movement</font>

points in your character<font color="#E5E5E5"> and the</font>

spectrum for you is not from point A to

00:02:01,739 --> 00:02:06,929
point B but from the weakest version of

52
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:08,610
yourself or the you you would rather not

53
00:02:06,930 --> 00:02:09,960
be the version of<font color="#E5E5E5"> yourself that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you are</font>

and the version<font color="#E5E5E5"> of yourself that I call</font>

56
00:02:12,719 --> 00:02:17,129
the strongest version of yourself so

57
00:02:14,699 --> 00:02:19,049
you're moving from week aspersion

58
00:02:17,129 --> 00:02:20,549
yourself strongest version yourself and

59
00:02:19,050 --> 00:02:21,600
along the<font color="#CCCCCC"> way you're going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to find</font>

60
00:02:20,550 --> 00:02:23,640
sticking points but how do you

61
00:02:21,599 --> 00:02:26,340
strengthen those sticking points like

62
00:02:23,639 --> 00:02:28,469
the athlete you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> he goes ahead and</font>

63
00:02:26,340 --> 00:02:31,050
discovers that well Mike for example my

64
00:02:28,469 --> 00:02:32,490
triceps are very weak so I can't extend

65
00:02:31,050 --> 00:02:34,740
fully at the top so he<font color="#E5E5E5"> goes and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> does</font>

66
00:02:32,490 --> 00:02:37,710
exercises to strengthen that particular

67
00:02:34,740 --> 00:02:39,719
part<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the movement that muscle for you</font>

68
00:02:37,710 --> 00:02:41,730
it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to be different you know you</font>

69
00:02:39,719 --> 00:02:43,710
can't exercise your muscles to

70
00:02:41,729 --> 00:02:46,229
strengthen your resolve and your

71
00:02:43,710 --> 00:02:47,280
character in life but what you can

72
00:02:46,229 --> 00:02:51,349
strengthen and what you should

73
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:54,599
strengthen or what are called virtues

74
00:02:51,349 --> 00:02:57,180
virtues lie along the spectrum of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">strength of your character there are all</font>

down below to a website that has a list

78

of virtues that you could study that way

79
00:03:04,169 --> 00:03:08,369
you can see<font color="#CCCCCC"> for example if I'm</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> not</font>
