00:00:00,350 --> 00:00:05,278
like many of the words in<font color="#E5E5E5"> our language</font>

2
00:00:03,080 --> 00:00:08,009
maturity is one of those<font color="#E5E5E5"> words</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

3
00:00:05,278 --> 00:00:11,129
become so sullied with implication that

4
00:00:08,009 --> 00:00:14,669
it loses its true essence a lot of times

5
00:00:11,130 --> 00:00:20,278
we use words that that convey at its

6
00:00:14,669 --> 00:00:21,868
<font color="#E5E5E5">core a beautiful message and when you</font>

7
00:00:20,278 --> 00:00:24,239
grow up as the oldest of four children

8
00:00:21,868 --> 00:00:27,028
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> you go to school and you know people</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">have certain expectations for you that</font>

10
00:00:27,028 --> 00:00:30,480
word maturity gets thrown around quite a

11
00:00:28,920 --> 00:00:31,920
bit and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm sure a lot</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of the young</font>

12
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:33,719
people watching these videos understand

13
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:36,210
what I'm saying when adults say to you

14
00:00:33,719 --> 00:00:38,219
you should behave<font color="#E5E5E5"> more mature why don't</font>

15
00:00:36,210 --> 00:00:41,250
you get it become a bit more<font color="#E5E5E5"> mature or</font>

16
00:00:38,219 --> 00:00:44,429
act more maturely it almost sounds like

17
00:00:41,250 --> 00:00:45,899
<font color="#CCCCCC">they're that word means do what I say be</font>

18
00:00:44,429 --> 00:00:52,409
more like me do what everyone else

19
00:00:45,899 --> 00:01:00,409
expects you to do so that word ends up

20
00:00:52,409 --> 00:01:04,618
taking on a lot of old boring dying dead

22
00:01:04,618 --> 00:01:10,049
experienced as I grow in my maturity

23
00:01:07,379 --> 00:01:12,478
through my experience and wisdom I'm

24
00:01:10,049 --> 00:01:14,189
discovering that that's not exactly true

25
00:01:12,478 --> 00:01:16,859
in fact maturity is<font color="#E5E5E5"> one of the most</font>

26
00:01:14,188 --> 00:01:21,529
beautiful words in the world and this is

00:01:16,859 --> 00:01:23,670
what I've discovered and have<font color="#CCCCCC"> decided to</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">approach the word from maturity is not</font>

30
00:01:27,688 --> 00:01:31,078
so much taking on the expectations or

following<font color="#E5E5E5"> through with what other people</font>
