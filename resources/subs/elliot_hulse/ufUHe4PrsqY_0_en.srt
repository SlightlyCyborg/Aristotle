taking you holy the opposite direction

15
00:00:35,070 --> 00:00:42,659
or some work greater and it's usually

16

18
00:00:44,369 --> 00:00:49,078
anybody like giving this advice to

several years later<font color="#E5E5E5"> they always say no</font>

20
00:00:49,079 --> 00:00:58,198
I'm think I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> really happy there's this</font>

21
00:00:51,628 --> 00:01:02,670
great song<font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> wasn't cuz your gut and</font>

22
00:00:58,198 --> 00:01:06,599
listening<font color="#E5E5E5"> to a lot calling the guy Jesus</font>

23
00:01:02,670 --> 00:01:08,549
guy who is very<font color="#CCCCCC"> straight he's like</font>

24
00:01:06,599 --> 00:01:10,228
there's a song I gotta remember

25
00:01:08,549 --> 00:01:13,290
basically he's happy for<font color="#E5E5E5"> all the she</font>

26
00:01:10,228 --> 00:01:14,760
wrote a song about like how happy is for

27
00:01:13,290 --> 00:01:16,830
not getting a little shit that he wanted

28
00:01:14,760 --> 00:01:20,700
because<font color="#E5E5E5"> it turned out</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to be so much</font>

29
00:01:16,829 --> 00:01:22,590
better so it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay have goals but don't</font>

30
00:01:20,700 --> 00:01:24,659
<font color="#E5E5E5">be personally identified with the goal</font>

31
00:01:22,590 --> 00:01:26,460
because now if you're personally

32
00:01:24,659 --> 00:01:29,340
identified with that goal you're going

33
00:01:26,459 --> 00:01:31,798
to build all the physical psychological

34
00:01:29,340 --> 00:01:33,630
constructs associated with what that

35
00:01:31,799 --> 00:01:35,549
should look like and you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to</font>

42
00:01:48,269 --> 00:01:53,280

43
00:01:51,688 --> 00:01:55,319
