rehabilitated to a degree from the

disease but<font color="#E5E5E5"> uh but she can't participate</font>

40
00:01:41,159 --> 00:01:47,070
in any of these healthful habits he says

41
00:01:44,399 --> 00:01:50,189
because she lives at home with her

42
00:01:47,069 --> 00:01:51,929
parents and maybe her parents have<font color="#CCCCCC"> had</font>

43
00:01:50,188 --> 00:01:54,059
nasty habits and maybe that's why she's

44
00:01:51,930 --> 00:01:56,579
sick but<font color="#E5E5E5"> anyway the thing is here he'll</font>

45
00:01:54,060 --> 00:01:58,228
goes on to also mention that she doesn't

46
00:01:56,578 --> 00:01:59,849
<font color="#E5E5E5">have a dream it's interesting that you</font>

47
00:01:58,228 --> 00:02:01,828
put that in there because you describe

48
00:01:59,849 --> 00:02:03,379
the entire question and then you say oh

49
00:02:01,828 --> 00:02:06,569
by the way she<font color="#CCCCCC"> doesn't have a dream</font>

50
00:02:03,379 --> 00:02:08,068
that's great man he wants to know what

51
00:02:06,569 --> 00:02:10,049
can I do<font color="#E5E5E5"> to help</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> support her become the</font>

00:02:10,050 --> 00:02:15,610
these circumstances so a man you

54
00:02:13,030 --> 00:02:16,800
to answered your own question by sharing

55
00:02:15,610 --> 00:02:19,330
the fact that she<font color="#E5E5E5"> doesn't have a dream</font>

56
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:21,400
what I want<font color="#CCCCCC"> to do is ask you what your</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">life or significant portion of it</font>

63
00:02:34,539 --> 00:02:38,169
<font color="#CCCCCC">together with her</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> raising a family</font>

64
00:02:36,009 --> 00:02:40,000
together living together and having a

65
00:02:38,169 --> 00:02:41,139
<font color="#E5E5E5">future together because that's you know</font>

66
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:43,840
one of the things<font color="#E5E5E5"> that we do when we</font>

67
00:02:41,139 --> 00:02:46,089
find women we decide is this going to be

68
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:47,530
my life partner if you feel<font color="#CCCCCC"> that she's</font>

69
00:02:46,090 --> 00:02:49,000
gonna be your<font color="#E5E5E5"> life partner then you've</font>

70
00:02:47,530 --> 00:02:51,729
got a dream and all you gotta do is make

71
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:55,449
<font color="#CCCCCC">sure that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> she's on the same dream boat</font>

72
00:02:51,729 --> 00:02:57,250
that you're on or because really you

73
00:02:55,449 --> 00:02:58,419
know all of this<font color="#E5E5E5"> really is contingent</font>

74
00:02:57,250 --> 00:02:59,949
upon the sentiment from which of

75
00:02:58,419 --> 00:03:02,589
proceeds are you with her because<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

76
00:02:59,949 --> 00:03:03,729
guilt you feel like you should a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

77
00:03:02,590 --> 00:03:05,979
times that happens especially when

78
00:03:03,729 --> 00:03:08,318
someone that we love gets sick we stay

79
00:03:05,979 --> 00:03:11,469
with them because we should we're

80
00:03:08,318 --> 00:03:13,509
supposed<font color="#CCCCCC"> to she was really</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> cool when we</font>

81
00:03:11,469 --> 00:03:14,859
were dating earlier on she got sick<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

82
00:03:13,509 --> 00:03:16,120
now I can't leave her<font color="#E5E5E5"> cuz her life's</font>

83
00:03:14,860 --> 00:03:19,120
bucked up and I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> gonna make it more</font>

84
00:03:16,120 --> 00:03:21,480
fucked up so that's called<font color="#E5E5E5"> moving or</font>

85
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:24,610
proceeding from the sentiment of fear

86
00:03:21,479 --> 00:03:26,859
guilt is a byproduct of fear and it

87
00:03:24,610 --> 00:03:28,780
never<font color="#E5E5E5"> works out really well</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you know</font>

88
00:03:26,860 --> 00:03:31,329
oftentimes we say that we stay with this

89
00:03:28,780 --> 00:03:33,519
person out of a sense of loyalty but if

90
00:03:31,329 --> 00:03:36,459
you dig deeper oftentimes it really is a

91
00:03:33,519 --> 00:03:38,349
sense of guilt no judgment I'm just

92
00:03:36,459 --> 00:03:41,739
saying make sure that you take a look

93
00:03:38,349 --> 00:03:43,599
clear look at<font color="#E5E5E5"> what your underlying</font>

94
00:03:41,739 --> 00:03:45,909
sentiment is your real reason for being

95
00:03:43,599 --> 00:03:47,500
with her right let me and you stay with

96
00:03:45,909 --> 00:03:49,060
her cuz the pussy's real good I don't

97
00:03:47,500 --> 00:03:51,159
know did you<font color="#E5E5E5"> ask yourself that question</font>

98
00:03:49,060 --> 00:03:53,859
what is<font color="#CCCCCC"> it that is keeping me with this</font>

99
00:03:51,159 --> 00:03:56,199

<font color="#E5E5E5">make sure she's on that same but with</font>

102
00:03:57,639 --> 00:04:04,409
you by enrolling her in that vision

103
00:04:00,359 --> 00:04:07,950

things that's going to be<font color="#CCCCCC"> associated</font>

147
