years of bringing them into reality

13
00:00:33,079 --> 00:00:38,089
right because you are a person who wants

14
00:00:36,409 --> 00:00:40,579
<font color="#CCCCCC">help actually help people change your</font>

15
00:00:38,090 --> 00:00:42,440
life it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not good enough to just give</font>

16
00:00:40,579 --> 00:00:46,879
them information give them tools you

17
00:00:42,439 --> 00:00:49,609
want to see it manifest another Bible

18
00:00:46,880 --> 00:00:53,359
story<font color="#E5E5E5"> not Christian but I mean this one</font>

19
00:00:49,609 --> 00:00:55,549
it's not good shit man I am at a phrase

20
00:00:53,359 --> 00:00:59,509
it properly but basically the story goes

21
00:00:55,549 --> 00:01:01,309
where<font color="#CCCCCC"> the farmer had seeds and he goes</font>

22
00:00:59,509 --> 00:01:02,329
and he spreads the CD to go down<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

23
00:01:01,310 --> 00:01:04,549
spreads disease because he needs to

24
00:01:02,329 --> 00:01:06,978
needs to manifest something see there's

25
00:01:04,549 --> 00:01:08,750
an idea right like your idea what

26
00:01:06,978 --> 00:01:12,170
manifests is the crime and<font color="#E5E5E5"> the flower</font>

27
00:01:08,750 --> 00:01:13,790
and the plant the fruit right but he

28
00:01:12,170 --> 00:01:15,950
goes have the bomber know who's that as

29
00:01:13,790 --> 00:01:19,460
he goes out and express the seeds that

30
00:01:15,950 --> 00:01:21,829
<font color="#CCCCCC">some of them will fall</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> on rocky ground</font>

31
00:01:19,459 --> 00:01:24,949
some of<font color="#CCCCCC"> them</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> will fall almost two weeks</font>

32
00:01:21,829 --> 00:01:26,868
right<font color="#CCCCCC"> rocky ground means there was no</font>

33
00:01:24,950 --> 00:01:28,519
potential there to begin with you<font color="#CCCCCC"> spread</font>

34
00:01:26,868 --> 00:01:30,618
your seed but there's no potentials

35
00:01:28,519 --> 00:01:34,039
there beginning this rocky ground spread

36
00:01:30,618 --> 00:01:35,750
about sea weeds things that look there's

37
00:01:34,040 --> 00:01:37,220
potential there but the person<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

38
00:01:35,750 --> 00:01:37,920
stifled and surrounded<font color="#CCCCCC"> by too much</font>

39
00:01:37,219 --> 00:01:41,858
negative

40
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:44,649
write a web address some of<font color="#E5E5E5"> it falls</font>

41
00:01:41,858 --> 00:01:46,509
upon<font color="#E5E5E5"> hold the birds take it so when you</font>

42
00:01:44,649 --> 00:01:48,399
spread it before when fertile ground but

43
00:01:46,509 --> 00:01:50,429
<font color="#CCCCCC">the bird comes and takes it basically</font>

44
00:01:48,399 --> 00:01:52,358
<font color="#CCCCCC">that person was distracted right</font>

45
00:01:50,429 --> 00:01:58,450
everything you did was right to put it

46
00:01:52,358 --> 00:02:01,239
from soil but no verb to me right the

47
00:01:58,450 --> 00:02:04,000
point is that<font color="#CCCCCC"> the farmer still gets up</font>

48
00:02:01,239 --> 00:02:06,789
and spreads its seeds and you<font color="#CCCCCC"> got</font>

49
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:10,719
<font color="#CCCCCC">recognized it as a as a sprinter like</font>

50
00:02:06,789 --> 00:02:13,390
demons you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> doing the thing you're</font>

51
00:02:10,719 --> 00:02:15,939
fulfilling your job as the farmer does

52
00:02:13,389 --> 00:02:18,958
but without lamenting on the rocky

53
00:02:15,939 --> 00:02:22,060
ground the weeds and<font color="#CCCCCC"> the birds</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

54
00:02:18,959 --> 00:02:25,030
focusing solely on the<font color="#CCCCCC"> fertile ground</font>

55
00:02:22,060 --> 00:02:28,420
that's followed that it's falling<font color="#E5E5E5"> on not</font>

56
00:02:25,030 --> 00:02:32,229
everyone's going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> get your thing is</font>

57
00:02:28,419 --> 00:02:33,189

58
00:02:32,229 --> 00:02:34,959
worry about you can't worry about

59
00:02:33,189 --> 00:02:36,340
everybody you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> there was a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> time</font>

60
00:02:34,959 --> 00:02:38,409
especially if you know you a personal

61
00:02:36,340 --> 00:02:40,780
trainer also so you actually work<font color="#CCCCCC"> with</font>

62
00:02:38,409 --> 00:02:43,359
people you want all your clients to<font color="#E5E5E5"> have</font>

63
00:02:40,780 --> 00:02:46,389

64
00:02:43,359 --> 00:02:47,870
feeling that<font color="#CCCCCC"> is that it like if bill</font>

the weeds<font color="#E5E5E5"> maybe there was never any</font>

69
00:02:56,419 --> 00:02:59,780
potential there anyway<font color="#CCCCCC"> and they're just</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">you know drinking</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> right there nice</font>

and it's just a part of the situation

84
00:03:24,669 --> 00:03:31,878
every one<font color="#E5E5E5"> of us has our own story we</font>

88
00:03:36,158 --> 00:03:41,209
but there's an objectivity<font color="#E5E5E5"> to the entire</font>

89
00:03:39,469 --> 00:03:43,639
thing you do it and you don't know

159
00:06:21,410 --> 00:06:25,520
<font color="#E5E5E5">why I try to keep things simple like the</font>

165
00:06:32,959 --> 00:06:35,668
wrong because

166
