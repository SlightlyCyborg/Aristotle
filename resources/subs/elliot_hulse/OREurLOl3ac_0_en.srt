26
00:01:02,909 --> 00:01:09,899
<font color="#E5E5E5">frustrated knowing</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that his woman had</font>

27
00:01:06,540 --> 00:01:12,868
this massive orgasm and the same face

28
00:01:09,900 --> 00:01:15,810

the problem the<font color="#CCCCCC"> problem is man that you</font>

33
00:01:28,530 --> 00:01:34,859
entertain that thought way too deeply

34
00:01:32,280 --> 00:01:36,900
the fact that you have the graphic

35
00:01:34,859 --> 00:01:38,609
description of what might have happened

36
00:01:36,900 --> 00:01:40,228

37
00:01:38,609 --> 00:01:42,390
they had<font color="#E5E5E5"> sex you're making this shit up</font>

38
00:01:40,228 --> 00:01:43,769
in your mind I mean most<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the fears</font>

39
00:01:42,390 --> 00:01:46,049
and problems of frustrations that we

40
00:01:43,769 --> 00:01:47,759
have our it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> made up shit in our own</font>

00:01:46,049 --> 00:01:48,990
head yeah she did have sex but you don't

42
00:01:47,759 --> 00:01:50,879
know what her orgasm face<font color="#CCCCCC"> looked</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> like</font>

43
00:01:48,989 --> 00:01:52,408
<font color="#E5E5E5">when she</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> was having sex with him you</font>

44
00:01:50,879 --> 00:01:55,259
don't know what that looked like at all

45
00:01:52,409 --> 00:01:57,390
so you might<font color="#CCCCCC"> be able to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> imagine is which</font>

46
00:01:55,259 --> 00:01:58,439
<font color="#E5E5E5">is what you're doing based on what it</font>

47
00:01:57,390 --> 00:02:00,739
looks like when you're having sex with

50
00:02:04,489 --> 00:02:11,068
emotion into the thought<font color="#CCCCCC"> you're you're</font>

51
00:02:08,098 --> 00:02:13,389
literally your<font color="#CCCCCC"> entire physiology is</font>

52
00:02:11,068 --> 00:02:15,609
being affected by<font color="#CCCCCC"> your</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> mom</font>

53
00:02:13,389 --> 00:02:19,419
<font color="#CCCCCC">and by your thought by an idea by</font>

54
00:02:15,610 --> 00:02:20,920
something<font color="#CCCCCC"> you made up right and you're</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">that idea you're entertaining it that's</font>

57
00:02:22,870 --> 00:02:25,750
what they mean when they say

00:02:31,419 --> 00:02:35,739
how powerful visualization is

63
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:38,470
visualization can literally check it

64
00:02:35,740 --> 00:02:41,140
does as your experience change your

00:02:38,469 --> 00:02:43,659
physiology or neuromuscular system your

66
00:02:41,139 --> 00:02:45,819
psychology you are literally creating

67
00:02:43,659 --> 00:02:48,609
new neural pathways<font color="#E5E5E5"> and secreting</font>

68
00:02:45,819 --> 00:02:51,280
hormones and neurotransmitters and all

visualizing some real fucked up shit

73
00:02:58,449 --> 00:03:04,089
stuff that you<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't need to visualize</font>

74
00:02:59,739 --> 00:03:08,019
the fact is she had sex with<font color="#CCCCCC"> another</font>

76
00:03:08,019 --> 00:03:13,090

103
00:04:18,279 --> 00:04:21,759
that automatic negative thought comes

automatic

106
00:04:22,810 --> 00:04:27,850
got to immediately replace it with

107
00:04:25,480 --> 00:04:30,490
another thought if they immediately see

108
00:04:27,850 --> 00:04:32,560
