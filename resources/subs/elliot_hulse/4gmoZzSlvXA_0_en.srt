00:00:10,050 --> 00:00:14,519
<font color="#E5E5E5">question from our strength camp online</font>

3
00:00:11,490 --> 00:00:17,250
member who goes on to ask Elliot what do

4
00:00:14,519 --> 00:00:20,278
I do when I'm a black sheep amongst<font color="#E5E5E5"> all</font>

5
00:00:17,250 --> 00:00:22,559
these white sheep he says he says<font color="#E5E5E5"> how is</font>

6
00:00:20,278 --> 00:00:25,410
<font color="#E5E5E5">it that the whole all these other sheet</font>

7
00:00:22,559 --> 00:00:28,079
want me to be<font color="#CCCCCC"> like them white and I'm</font>

8
00:00:25,410 --> 00:00:29,368
black I'm different all right and they

9
00:00:28,079 --> 00:00:32,238
just<font color="#CCCCCC"> keep making me want to be like them</font>

10
00:00:29,368 --> 00:00:34,590
but I want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be black I don't</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> now do I</font>

11
00:00:32,238 --> 00:00:37,169
continue to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be my black sheep and then</font>

12
00:00:34,590 --> 00:00:41,280
become a lion you know kind of playing

13
00:00:37,170 --> 00:00:44,820
on that thus spoke zarathustra video<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

14
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:46,920
made once or you know do I fight against

15
00:00:44,820 --> 00:00:51,420
all these white sheets trying to kick me

16
00:00:46,920 --> 00:00:55,050
down and it had me thinking you know

17
00:00:51,420 --> 00:00:57,359
because I've often felt like that you

18
00:00:55,049 --> 00:01:00,808
know and I think we<font color="#CCCCCC"> all feel like that</font>

19
00:00:57,359 --> 00:01:03,238
at some point you know and um I think

20
00:01:00,808 --> 00:01:05,399
it's pretty human to feel like<font color="#E5E5E5"> a black</font>

21
00:01:03,238 --> 00:01:07,048
sheep I don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> think there are real black</font>

22
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:09,510
sheeps I think there are people<font color="#CCCCCC"> that act</font>

23
00:01:07,049 --> 00:01:12,090
out in a black sheep fashion I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think</font>

24
00:01:09,510 --> 00:01:14,790
there are people who are<font color="#CCCCCC"> really addicted</font>

25
00:01:12,090 --> 00:01:16,409
to the idea that I'm a black sheep but I

26
00:01:14,790 --> 00:01:18,118
think<font color="#CCCCCC"> the whole black sheep thing is</font>

27
00:01:16,409 --> 00:01:20,549
pretty universal we all think we're

28
00:01:18,118 --> 00:01:24,079
special right and we all are special and

29
00:01:20,549 --> 00:01:27,450
everybody else is just a landscape of

30
00:01:24,079 --> 00:01:30,420
homogenized milk right<font color="#E5E5E5"> they're all the</font>

31
00:01:27,450 --> 00:01:35,460
same and mixed and I am special it's a

32
00:01:30,420 --> 00:01:38,549
<font color="#CCCCCC">normal feeling but um taken too far and</font>

33
00:01:35,459 --> 00:01:41,969
coming from the wrong context can sort

34
00:01:38,549 --> 00:01:45,079
of screw you up what do I mean taken too

35
00:01:41,969 --> 00:01:47,548
far it becomes narcissism meaning<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

36
00:01:45,078 --> 00:01:50,219
we become attached to the image that

37
00:01:47,549 --> 00:01:52,110
<font color="#CCCCCC">we've</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> created for ourselves such that we</font>

38
00:01:50,219 --> 00:01:54,000
can create contrast between ourselves

39
00:01:52,109 --> 00:01:55,649
and others in other words you got to

40
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:57,930
keep trying harder and harder to be more

41
00:01:55,649 --> 00:01:59,280
<font color="#E5E5E5">and more different right because</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it's</font>

42
00:01:57,930 --> 00:02:00,990
all about<font color="#E5E5E5"> that image how can I continue</font>

43
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:03,718
being more different you know because

44
00:02:00,989 --> 00:02:05,368
there's tension there it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> almost like</font>

45
00:02:03,718 --> 00:02:09,179
when you know I've<font color="#E5E5E5"> got children that are</font>

46
00:02:05,368 --> 00:02:11,098
becoming teenagers or becoming adults

47
00:02:09,179 --> 00:02:12,750
and I see what's<font color="#E5E5E5"> happening and I</font>

48
00:02:11,098 --> 00:02:13,379
understand what's happening they've got

49
00:02:12,750 --> 00:02:15,840
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> create</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> con</font>

50
00:02:13,379 --> 00:02:17,579
trust between themselves and me and

51
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:18,960
their parents because for you to stand

52
00:02:17,580 --> 00:02:21,980
on your own two feet for<font color="#CCCCCC"> you to have</font>

53
00:02:18,960 --> 00:02:24,180
your own identity you have to create

54
00:02:21,979 --> 00:02:26,250
separation you've got to<font color="#E5E5E5"> create tension</font>

55
00:02:24,180 --> 00:02:30,290
between that which you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> houma</font>

56
00:02:26,250 --> 00:02:33,599
homogenized white milk sheep and me

57
00:02:30,289 --> 00:02:35,909
right and it's okay so it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> not</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it's</font>

58
00:02:33,599 --> 00:02:37,949
normal natural but taking too far you

59
00:02:35,909 --> 00:02:39,449
spend your<font color="#CCCCCC"> whole life as a teenager I</font>

60
00:02:37,949 --> 00:02:41,549
don't know how old<font color="#E5E5E5"> you are but it's a</font>

61
00:02:39,449 --> 00:02:44,429
very adolescent idea it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> a very</font>

62
00:02:41,550 --> 00:02:46,980
adolescent behavior I gotta give

63
00:02:44,430 --> 00:02:48,960
completely honest a lot of my life a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot</font>

64
00:02:46,979 --> 00:02:52,469
of a good part of my early adult life

65
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:54,629
was being caught in the adolescence of I

66
00:02:52,469 --> 00:02:56,789
have to keep<font color="#E5E5E5"> being different I mean I</font>

67
00:02:54,629 --> 00:02:59,250
was different<font color="#CCCCCC"> I look different from you</font>

68
00:02:56,789 --> 00:03:02,039
know majority I was homogenized milk

69
00:02:59,250 --> 00:03:06,210
around<font color="#E5E5E5"> me</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and Here I am you know not too</font>

70
00:03:02,039 --> 00:03:07,919
sure what you are you know and uh you

71
00:03:06,210 --> 00:03:09,270
know<font color="#E5E5E5"> and in various other aspects so it</font>

72
00:03:07,919 --> 00:03:12,269
kind of was like a<font color="#CCCCCC"> little bit</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of a black</font>

73
00:03:09,270 --> 00:03:15,120
sheep but then I identified with it and

74
00:03:12,270 --> 00:03:18,120
I carried it with me and then and when I

75
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:21,469
spoke earlier about context the context

76
00:03:18,120 --> 00:03:24,719
of it continued to grow in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the negative</font>

77
00:03:21,469 --> 00:03:28,259
frequency of fear and having to prove

78
00:03:24,719 --> 00:03:29,639
myself right so if you're you're a black

79
00:03:28,259 --> 00:03:31,469
sheep and you've got<font color="#E5E5E5"> all</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> these white</font>

80
00:03:29,639 --> 00:03:33,569
sheep around you and you've created this

81
00:03:31,469 --> 00:03:34,859
contrast now what you got to do is you

82
00:03:33,569 --> 00:03:38,579
got<font color="#CCCCCC"> to prove yourself that you're good</font>

83
00:03:34,860 --> 00:03:40,050
enough and that that having to prove

84
00:03:38,580 --> 00:03:41,880
yourself having to prove<font color="#CCCCCC"> that you're</font>

85
00:03:40,050 --> 00:03:43,200
good enough having to constantly show

86
00:03:41,879 --> 00:03:46,769
how you're different and how you're

87
00:03:43,199 --> 00:03:48,599
better comes from fear it's a fear-based

88
00:03:46,770 --> 00:03:51,030
frequencies fear-based ideas fear-based

89
00:03:48,599 --> 00:03:53,819
attitude and everything that you get

90
00:03:51,030 --> 00:03:55,949
will come<font color="#E5E5E5"> from your fear everything</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

91
00:03:53,819 --> 00:03:58,829
you don't get will<font color="#CCCCCC"> be a byproduct of</font>

92
00:03:55,949 --> 00:04:01,409
<font color="#E5E5E5">your fear and you'll be the scared black</font>

93
00:03:58,830 --> 00:04:03,990
sheep feeling all alone amongst all the

94
00:04:01,409 --> 00:04:08,280
white sheep were cool and they all think

95
00:04:03,990 --> 00:04:09,870
they're different to you see but you've

96
00:04:08,280 --> 00:04:12,330
isolated yourself you know no wonder why

97
00:04:09,870 --> 00:04:15,689
so many<font color="#E5E5E5"> people feel isolated you know</font>

98
00:04:12,330 --> 00:04:17,370
stop isolating yourself man unless it

99
00:04:15,689 --> 00:04:23,399
comes from<font color="#E5E5E5"> the other end of the spectrum</font>

100
00:04:17,370 --> 00:04:24,720
is what you're doing coming from your

101
00:04:23,399 --> 00:04:26,949
love

102
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:29,380
because if it's coming from love than

103
00:04:26,949 --> 00:04:32,019
there really is no tension to be a black

104
00:04:29,379 --> 00:04:36,550
sheep which we all are in our own way

105
00:04:32,019 --> 00:04:39,099
but from the pure context of love means

106
00:04:36,550 --> 00:04:41,050
that we really don't have to create any

107
00:04:39,100 --> 00:04:43,000
tension we really don't have to create

108
00:04:41,050 --> 00:04:45,400
any contrast between ourselves you're

109
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:47,860
just being who you are you're just doing

110
00:04:45,399 --> 00:04:49,810
who you are you're like that bird I

111
00:04:47,860 --> 00:04:51,970
spoke about<font color="#CCCCCC"> in various videos you know</font>

112
00:04:49,810 --> 00:04:53,920
where the bird is just singing it song

113
00:04:51,970 --> 00:04:55,690
if you like it the birds like well<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

114
00:04:53,920 --> 00:04:57,939
that's great I'm happy that you like<font color="#CCCCCC"> me</font>

115
00:04:55,689 --> 00:05:00,069
but I'm just doing<font color="#CCCCCC"> my thing tweeting my</font>

116
00:04:57,939 --> 00:05:01,990
song if you throw a<font color="#CCCCCC"> rock out in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it does</font>

117
00:05:00,069 --> 00:05:03,879
<font color="#E5E5E5">you the birds like fuck you don't like</font>

118
00:05:01,990 --> 00:05:04,990
me or you say I<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't like you bird you</font>

119
00:05:03,879 --> 00:05:08,139
woke me up this morning what the bird

120
00:05:04,990 --> 00:05:11,199
says I<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't give a shit I'm gonna be</font>

121
00:05:08,139 --> 00:05:13,810
here singing<font color="#CCCCCC"> my song anyway I don't even</font>

122
00:05:11,199 --> 00:05:15,579
know you I don't notice<font color="#E5E5E5"> you when you're</font>

123
00:05:13,810 --> 00:05:17,860
moving from love you don't even notice

124
00:05:15,579 --> 00:05:19,300
the contrast you're so busy doing the

125
00:05:17,860 --> 00:05:21,160
thing that you love that<font color="#CCCCCC"> you don't have</font>

126
00:05:19,300 --> 00:05:24,100
any time to be talking<font color="#E5E5E5"> about how you're</font>

127
00:05:21,160 --> 00:05:28,810
a black sheep so forget the whole black

128
00:05:24,100 --> 00:05:32,260
sheep thing enroll and developing your

129
00:05:28,810 --> 00:05:35,050
love for something think about<font color="#E5E5E5"> how</font>

130
00:05:32,259 --> 00:05:37,480
you're going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> contribute to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the white</font>

131
00:05:35,050 --> 00:05:39,009
sheep right<font color="#E5E5E5"> because they're just as</font>

132
00:05:37,480 --> 00:05:41,170
black as you and you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> just as white as</font>

133
00:05:39,009 --> 00:05:43,269
them you think<font color="#E5E5E5"> we think we're so much</font>

134
00:05:41,170 --> 00:05:46,480
different but we're not we're special

135
00:05:43,269 --> 00:05:48,129
but we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> not different we're all kind</font>

136
00:05:46,480 --> 00:05:53,530
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the same we're all having it's very</font>

137
00:05:48,129 --> 00:05:58,680
similar experiences rather than proving

138
00:05:53,529 --> 00:06:02,519
yourself right proving them wrong and

139
00:05:58,680 --> 00:06:02,519
trying to get<font color="#CCCCCC"> something for nothing</font>

140
00:06:04,069 --> 00:06:11,459
serve the white sheep be careful with

141
00:06:09,480 --> 00:06:13,069
that one too man people people

142
00:06:11,459 --> 00:06:16,049
especially a lot of these like

143
00:06:13,069 --> 00:06:19,469
missionaries they like to serve from

144
00:06:16,050 --> 00:06:23,400
this place of piety and I'm better than

145
00:06:19,470 --> 00:06:26,640
you but<font color="#E5E5E5"> if you really are in love if you</font>

146
