00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,169
<font color="#E5E5E5">hey whats up guys its Elliot I'm back</font>

2
00:00:01,949 --> 00:00:06,419
and if you've noticed past couple weeks

3
00:00:04,169 --> 00:00:08,160
i haven't uploaded any videos for a

4
00:00:06,419 --> 00:00:10,830
number of reasons none of what<font color="#E5E5E5"> number</font>

5
00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:14,429
one of which is I've needed some time to

6
00:00:10,830 --> 00:00:15,839
sharpen my axe and what that means is is

7
00:00:14,429 --> 00:00:18,359
if you're always chopping chopping

8
00:00:15,839 --> 00:00:21,210
chopping chopping working in any

9
00:00:18,359 --> 00:00:23,760
endeavor that is you know expression of

10
00:00:21,210 --> 00:00:26,580
who you are you'll find that you grow

11
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:29,220
dull after a while now you might not

12
00:00:26,579 --> 00:00:31,528
notice this but<font color="#E5E5E5"> I noticed this so</font>

13
00:00:29,219 --> 00:00:34,469
sharpening your ax is a concept by which

14
00:00:31,528 --> 00:00:37,100
you take some time<font color="#CCCCCC"> off to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> hone</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> your</font>

15
00:00:34,469 --> 00:00:39,149
skills to<font color="#CCCCCC"> develop yourself to go in</font>

16
00:00:37,100 --> 00:00:41,340
especially if you're always going out

17
00:00:39,149 --> 00:00:44,250
and making these videos every<font color="#CCCCCC"> day is a</font>

18
00:00:41,340 --> 00:00:47,760
pure expression of me letting my

19
00:00:44,250 --> 00:00:50,850
energies out so taking<font color="#CCCCCC"> some time off for</font>

20
00:00:47,759 --> 00:00:52,738
myself has been beneficial<font color="#E5E5E5"> and I as I'm</font>

21
00:00:50,850 --> 00:00:55,948
going to describe within the next few

22
00:00:52,738 --> 00:00:57,299
minutes I also invite to you to take

23
00:00:55,948 --> 00:00:59,280
<font color="#E5E5E5">some</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> time off</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> from whatever it is that</font>

24
00:00:57,299 --> 00:01:01,468
<font color="#E5E5E5">you're doing you can't it can't be</font>

25
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:04,140
summertime all the time if<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's always</font>

26
00:01:01,469 --> 00:01:07,530
summer there's Sun will scorch the earth

27
00:01:04,140 --> 00:01:11,519
you need winters you need falls so that

28
00:01:07,530 --> 00:01:13,409
you can<font color="#CCCCCC"> have a prolific spring and these</font>

29
00:01:11,519 --> 00:01:14,670
times<font color="#E5E5E5"> that we take off from whatever it</font>

30
00:01:13,409 --> 00:01:16,500
is that we do I don't care<font color="#E5E5E5"> if its</font>

31
00:01:14,670 --> 00:01:19,320
strength training I don't care if<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's</font>

32
00:01:16,500 --> 00:01:23,700
school you need these times for winter

33
00:01:19,319 --> 00:01:27,478
for recovery for rejuvenation for

34
00:01:23,700 --> 00:01:29,579
sharpening your ax and like I said I

35
00:01:27,478 --> 00:01:33,719
invite you guys to do<font color="#CCCCCC"> the same thing and</font>

36
00:01:29,578 --> 00:01:36,029
that's what I gleaned after several

37
00:01:33,719 --> 00:01:40,400
<font color="#E5E5E5">weeks of reflection on what it is that I</font>

38
00:01:36,030 --> 00:01:42,180
actually do in fact what it is that

39
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:44,159
holds the foundation<font color="#CCCCCC"> for our</font>

40
00:01:42,180 --> 00:01:46,170
relationship<font color="#CCCCCC"> with one another because as</font>

41
00:01:44,159 --> 00:01:48,420
strange as it may seem I'm talking to a

42
00:01:46,170 --> 00:01:51,149
glass lens and you're<font color="#CCCCCC"> looking at a</font>

43
00:01:48,420 --> 00:01:53,728
<font color="#CCCCCC">freaking computer screen or a tablet</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> or</font>

44
00:01:51,149 --> 00:01:55,228
your phone but there's still a

45
00:01:53,728 --> 00:01:58,259
relationship because we're interacting

46
00:01:55,228 --> 00:01:59,670
with one another and I've had some time

47
00:01:58,259 --> 00:02:02,218
<font color="#CCCCCC">to think about what did what are</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we</font>

48
00:01:59,670 --> 00:02:06,509
doing what are we up to why do I talk to

49
00:02:02,218 --> 00:02:08,909
<font color="#CCCCCC">you why do</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you listen to me and I come</font>

50
00:02:06,509 --> 00:02:10,649
<font color="#CCCCCC">to a few different ideas that I wanted</font>

51
00:02:08,909 --> 00:02:13,060
<font color="#E5E5E5">to clarify because I've been doing this</font>

52
00:02:10,649 --> 00:02:14,800
for so<font color="#CCCCCC"> long but also</font>

53
00:02:13,060 --> 00:02:16,568
point or highlight so that we can

54
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:17,800
continue<font color="#E5E5E5"> to move forward so that we can</font>

55
00:02:16,568 --> 00:02:20,079
do this and have a symbiotic

56
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:23,170
relationship so that we can all grow

57
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:25,569
stronger because that is the goal

58
00:02:23,169 --> 00:02:28,030
everything that<font color="#CCCCCC"> I offer you guys comes</font>

59
00:02:25,568 --> 00:02:29,708
in the form of a invitation and the

60
00:02:28,030 --> 00:02:32,500
<font color="#E5E5E5">reason why is because i have nothing</font>

61
00:02:29,709 --> 00:02:37,509
permanent nothing true nothing right

62
00:02:32,500 --> 00:02:42,068
nothing concrete to give anyone you see

63
00:02:37,509 --> 00:02:43,959
I am I have low<font color="#CCCCCC"> self-esteem</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> me sounds</font>

64
00:02:42,068 --> 00:02:47,259
strange Elliot you're so dynamic you're

65
00:02:43,959 --> 00:02:48,459
so prolific you're so motivating you

66
00:02:47,259 --> 00:02:50,530
have the courage<font color="#CCCCCC"> to get on this camera</font>

67
00:02:48,459 --> 00:02:52,209
every day you<font color="#E5E5E5"> have a lot of interesting</font>

68
00:02:50,530 --> 00:02:55,840
<font color="#CCCCCC">things to say but how is it could your</font>

69
00:02:52,209 --> 00:02:58,030
<font color="#E5E5E5">self-esteem be just as low as mine the</font>

70
00:02:55,840 --> 00:03:00,580
reason why I do what I do the<font color="#E5E5E5"> reason why</font>

71
00:02:58,030 --> 00:03:02,560
I am so happy<font color="#E5E5E5"> to share these ideas with</font>

72
00:03:00,580 --> 00:03:05,230
you guys is because I'm working every

73
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:06,489
single day on the same problems that you

74
00:03:05,229 --> 00:03:09,818
guys offered me through the questions

75
00:03:06,489 --> 00:03:12,849
that you said I'd like<font color="#E5E5E5"> to say or it'd be</font>

76
00:03:09,818 --> 00:03:15,488
<font color="#E5E5E5">nice or perhaps others would appreciate</font>

77
00:03:12,848 --> 00:03:18,639
seeing me as someone sitting up on a

78
00:03:15,489 --> 00:03:21,310
higher chair or a higher horse than the

79
00:03:18,639 --> 00:03:23,708
rest of<font color="#E5E5E5"> us but it's not</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the fact the</font>

80
00:03:21,310 --> 00:03:26,170
fact is that I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> probably lower than you</font>

81
00:03:23,709 --> 00:03:29,560
in many ways I'm behind you in many ways

82
00:03:26,169 --> 00:03:31,568
and in that I'm always trying to catch

83
00:03:29,560 --> 00:03:32,620
<font color="#CCCCCC">up so I'm neurotic I always talking</font>

about<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know breaking up neurotic</font>

85
00:03:32,620 --> 00:03:35,289
holding patterns and how have you come

86
00:03:33,969 --> 00:03:37,150
neurotic the reason why I'm so obsessed

87
00:03:35,289 --> 00:03:39,159
with that<font color="#E5E5E5"> because i am neurotic I'm</font>

88
00:03:37,150 --> 00:03:41,129
always reading I'm always studying i'm

89
00:03:39,159 --> 00:03:43,568
always experimenting<font color="#E5E5E5"> i'm always</font>

90
00:03:41,129 --> 00:03:46,539
experiencing life so that<font color="#E5E5E5"> i can figure</font>

91
00:03:43,568 --> 00:03:47,768
this thing out one of the things<font color="#E5E5E5"> i</font>

92
00:03:46,539 --> 00:03:51,939

that I'm answering these questions for

98

<font color="#E5E5E5">the pits that you're in and not all</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

exactly the<font color="#CCCCCC"> same but</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> there are</font>

103
00:04:10,870 --> 00:04:14,549
principles that's one of the things that

104
00:04:12,068 --> 00:04:20,680
<font color="#E5E5E5">have discovered in my trying to catch up</font>

trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be good</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> enough trying to live</font>

version of myself

109
00:04:26,050 --> 00:04:30,009
and inviting you as I go along showing

110
00:04:28,180 --> 00:04:31,389
you what I've discovered one of the

111
00:04:30,009 --> 00:04:35,620
things I've realized<font color="#E5E5E5"> that their</font>

112
00:04:31,389 --> 00:04:37,389
principles they're<font color="#CCCCCC"> just a handful the</font>

113
00:04:35,620 --> 00:04:39,430
content of the questions that you guys

114
00:04:37,389 --> 00:04:41,439
<font color="#E5E5E5">ask me the content of the answers that I</font>

00:04:39,430 --> 00:04:43,060
gave you are not nearly as important as

116
00:04:41,439 --> 00:04:45,310
the context<font color="#CCCCCC"> that means that the</font>

117

container through which all of the

118
00:04:45,310 --> 00:04:49,839
different flavors are dropped in is more

119
00:04:48,310 --> 00:04:51,848
important than the flavor that's dropped

00:04:49,839 --> 00:04:53,500
in were poured into<font color="#E5E5E5"> the bowl and there</font>

are only a handful of bowls or handful

of cups and those are the<font color="#E5E5E5"> things that I</font>

123
00:04:55,569 --> 00:05:01,360
try to approach my conversation with you

00:04:59,110 --> 00:05:03,729
through getting to the root issues

125
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:05,348
getting too why is<font color="#E5E5E5"> it that we're having</font>

126
00:05:03,728 --> 00:05:07,300
these problems why is it that these

00:05:07,300 --> 00:05:10,718
can't get over my soul low self-esteem

129
00:05:09,189 --> 00:05:12,668
<font color="#E5E5E5">why is it they don't have the courage</font>

130
00:05:10,718 --> 00:05:14,288
why is<font color="#E5E5E5"> it that I'm not strong enough why</font>

131
00:05:12,668 --> 00:05:18,128
is it that I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> not brave enough why is</font>

00:05:14,288 --> 00:05:21,038
<font color="#E5E5E5">it that i am not enough and there are a</font>

handful of principles guiding principles

that won't answer that<font color="#E5E5E5"> question you know</font>

135
00:05:24,459 --> 00:05:27,279
so sometimes<font color="#E5E5E5"> people want to know why is</font>

136
00:05:25,930 --> 00:05:29,168
it that<font color="#CCCCCC"> Elia feels that he can answer</font>

questions about sex why is<font color="#E5E5E5"> it the</font>

questions about psychology philosophy

140
00:05:32,788 --> 00:05:41,199
religion because that those things are

141
00:05:37,269 --> 00:05:44,228
just the flavor of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the juice that's in a</font>

00:05:41,199 --> 00:05:47,520

143
00:05:44,228 --> 00:05:51,699
you it's the bigger picture if you will

144
00:05:47,519 --> 00:05:56,049
understand so as we move<font color="#E5E5E5"> forward as I</font>
