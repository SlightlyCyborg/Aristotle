1
00:00:00,110 --> 00:00:05,040
so just a<font color="#CCCCCC"> few minutes</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> ago I posted a</font>

2
00:00:02,339 --> 00:00:06,689
picture<font color="#E5E5E5"> of my facebook wall that is from</font>

3
00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:08,400
a book that I'm reading and in the book

4
00:00:06,690 --> 00:00:11,130
there<font color="#CCCCCC"> is a description of the law of</font>

5
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:14,490
<font color="#E5E5E5">polarity and I describe how I've used</font>

6
00:00:11,130 --> 00:00:17,250
this idea to<font color="#E5E5E5"> navigate my life in in many</font>

7
00:00:14,490 --> 00:00:19,649
<font color="#E5E5E5">instances but briefly the law of</font>

8
00:00:17,250 --> 00:00:23,368
<font color="#E5E5E5">polarity states that inherent in every</font>

9
00:00:19,649 --> 00:00:25,879
extreme is its polar opposite so we as

10
00:00:23,368 --> 00:00:28,649
human beings we'd like to separate

11
00:00:25,879 --> 00:00:30,390
opposites into good and bad but

12
00:00:28,649 --> 00:00:33,899
essentially in the same way that you

13
00:00:30,390 --> 00:00:36,539
cannot have day without night you can't

14
00:00:33,899 --> 00:00:40,280
have good without evil they're one in

15
00:00:36,539 --> 00:00:44,700
the same the difference is in degrees

16
00:00:40,280 --> 00:00:46,679
right so up and down they're polar

17
00:00:44,700 --> 00:00:48,450
opposites but the<font color="#CCCCCC"> differences in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> degrees</font>

18
00:00:46,679 --> 00:00:51,659
depends on where you're standing<font color="#E5E5E5"> right</font>

19
00:00:48,450 --> 00:00:53,370
it all depends so one of the questions

20
00:00:51,659 --> 00:00:55,939
that came in was<font color="#CCCCCC"> Elliot how do you</font>

21
00:00:53,369 --> 00:00:58,979
actually use this idea of polarity in

22
00:00:55,939 --> 00:01:00,839
the choices that you make in your life

23
00:00:58,979 --> 00:01:03,599
I'm going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to use a really good</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> example</font>

24
00:01:00,840 --> 00:01:07,200
because I spoke to you earlier this week

25
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:09,030
about the necessity for action so

26
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:12,090
earlier this week I made a video where I

27
00:01:09,030 --> 00:01:14,280
talked about<font color="#E5E5E5"> if you find that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the waters</font>

28
00:01:12,090 --> 00:01:15,960
of change in your life are stagnant

29
00:01:14,280 --> 00:01:18,719
things are not the way you'd<font color="#CCCCCC"> like them</font>

30
00:01:15,959 --> 00:01:20,959
to be but they're very<font color="#CCCCCC"> comfortable you</font>

31
00:01:18,719 --> 00:01:24,150
will get very stuck in this place of

32
00:01:20,959 --> 00:01:26,158
resistance against action and<font color="#E5E5E5"> that means</font>

33
00:01:24,150 --> 00:01:29,368
you've got to take action<font color="#CCCCCC"> oftentimes</font>

34
00:01:26,159 --> 00:01:31,859
<font color="#E5E5E5">very uncomfortable action so the</font>

35
00:01:29,368 --> 00:01:33,409
metaphor that I used was jumping off the

36
00:01:31,859 --> 00:01:35,670
bridge or jumping off a cliff and

37
00:01:33,409 --> 00:01:37,680
learning how<font color="#E5E5E5"> to fly in the way down this</font>

38
00:01:35,670 --> 00:01:41,700
is needed in order for you to continue

39
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:43,590
advancing in your life now the exact

40
00:01:41,700 --> 00:01:46,909
opposite<font color="#E5E5E5"> of that is true and in my</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> life</font>

41
00:01:43,590 --> 00:01:50,969
<font color="#E5E5E5">and I'm experiencing something of a</font>

42
00:01:46,909 --> 00:01:52,439
degree whereby I need non action and not

43
00:01:50,969 --> 00:01:54,420
action doesn't necessarily mean that you

44
00:01:52,438 --> 00:01:58,199
sit by and wait for things to happen<font color="#E5E5E5"> not</font>

45
00:01:54,420 --> 00:02:00,049
<font color="#E5E5E5">action is a form of allowing which</font>

46
00:01:58,200 --> 00:02:02,700
basically means if things are going

47
00:02:00,049 --> 00:02:04,799
really crazy in your<font color="#E5E5E5"> life you know I</font>

48
00:02:02,700 --> 00:02:07,049
also use the metaphor of a tornado

49
00:02:04,799 --> 00:02:08,429
things are spinning around so for

50
00:02:07,049 --> 00:02:11,250
example in my<font color="#E5E5E5"> life you know you've</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> got</font>

51
00:02:08,429 --> 00:02:13,229
four children I've got I have to<font color="#E5E5E5"> move</font>

52
00:02:11,250 --> 00:02:13,680
<font color="#CCCCCC">now we were in a situation where I've</font>

53
00:02:13,229 --> 00:02:16,108
got a

54
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:19,859
my family my business is evolving at a

55
00:02:16,109 --> 00:02:23,879
rapid rapid rate and things are going

56
00:02:19,859 --> 00:02:25,950
crazy<font color="#E5E5E5"> I am</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> sensitive enough to recognize</font>

57
00:02:23,878 --> 00:02:28,620
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> this is an opportunity for non</font>

58
00:02:25,949 --> 00:02:31,169
action because if I are were to proceed

59
00:02:28,620 --> 00:02:34,230
forward in the trying to make things

60
00:02:31,169 --> 00:02:37,259
happen meanwhile things are going<font color="#E5E5E5"> crazy</font>

61
00:02:34,229 --> 00:02:40,709
I could screw up the processes<font color="#E5E5E5"> instead I</font>

62
00:02:37,259 --> 00:02:42,989
have to allow or proceed<font color="#CCCCCC"> in non action</font>

63
00:02:40,709 --> 00:02:47,009
<font color="#E5E5E5">in order to be</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the most resourceful</font>

64
00:02:42,989 --> 00:02:48,989
place for life to evolve for my life to

65
00:02:47,009 --> 00:02:50,459
<font color="#CCCCCC">move forward if I interfere I know</font>

66
00:02:48,989 --> 00:02:54,060
there's only<font color="#E5E5E5"> out of experience but also</font>

67
00:02:50,459 --> 00:02:56,009
out of studying if I interfere I can

68
00:02:54,060 --> 00:02:57,628
screw up the whole thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> so there</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

69
00:02:56,009 --> 00:02:59,598
have the two complete opposites there

70
00:02:57,628 --> 00:03:03,209
you have polar opposites action and

71
00:02:59,598 --> 00:03:06,060
allowing or non-action both of which you

72
00:03:03,209 --> 00:03:08,310
have<font color="#E5E5E5"> to look at and say yes it's good</font>

73
00:03:06,060 --> 00:03:09,299
it's necessary<font color="#CCCCCC"> there are tools that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

74
00:03:08,310 --> 00:03:11,848
need to use but you've got to be

75
00:03:09,299 --> 00:03:14,310
sensitive<font color="#E5E5E5"> enough to know when to use</font>

76
00:03:11,848 --> 00:03:16,289
what tool instead of saying it's all

77
00:03:14,310 --> 00:03:20,189
about action and if you don't take

78
00:03:16,289 --> 00:03:22,168
<font color="#CCCCCC">action you're kind of lazy or saying</font>

79
00:03:20,189 --> 00:03:23,818
that uh you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> being in a place where</font>

80
00:03:22,169 --> 00:03:25,709
<font color="#E5E5E5">it's all about non action and you</font>

81
00:03:23,818 --> 00:03:28,560
actually are lazy when action time comes

82
00:03:25,709 --> 00:03:33,419
um you fumble so that's it you got<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

83
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:37,859
recognize<font color="#E5E5E5"> that inherent in every extreme</font>

84
00:03:33,419 --> 00:03:39,479
is<font color="#E5E5E5"> a say I is it cos</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it's complete</font>

85
00:03:37,859 --> 00:03:41,849
opposite and you've got<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be sensitive</font>

86
00:03:39,479 --> 00:03:45,620
<font color="#E5E5E5">enough to know when the appropriate</font>
