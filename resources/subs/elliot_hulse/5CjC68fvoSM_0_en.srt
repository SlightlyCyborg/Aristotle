expression of psychological castration

from the body the body represents the

part of us that things went out of

the position of control this is in

position and it's fearful control

38
00:01:37,500 --> 00:01:42,118
because you gotta be courageous to just

basically what i want to say just<font color="#E5E5E5"> I mean</font>

44
00:01:52,739 --> 00:01:58,349
that could either be like a way to

45
00:01:55,319 --> 00:02:00,328
diagnose like what<font color="#E5E5E5"> that person might</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> be</font>

46
00:01:58,349 --> 00:02:01,479
thinking about like what what's really

47
00:02:00,328 --> 00:02:02,969
<font color="#E5E5E5">going on their head</font>

48
00:02:01,480 --> 00:02:05,230
choices are making the life that have

49
00:02:02,969 --> 00:02:07,000
that's maybe the kind of personality

50
00:02:05,230 --> 00:02:08,650
like oh I always need to be<font color="#E5E5E5"> in</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> control</font>

51
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:10,569
at all times I need to see everything

52
00:02:08,650 --> 00:02:13,750
like it's always<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to be the same</font>

53
00:02:10,569 --> 00:02:15,129
any with you if you look up or down but

54
00:02:13,750 --> 00:02:17,469
what you forget about your heart you

55
00:02:15,129 --> 00:02:18,789
forget about you know being grounded and

56
00:02:17,469 --> 00:02:21,310
all this stuff because<font color="#E5E5E5"> you just want to</font>

57
00:02:18,789 --> 00:02:23,199
satisfy this one here we're going off

58
00:02:21,310 --> 00:02:25,210
you're going strong let me by

59
00:02:23,199 --> 00:02:28,629
mechanically or stronger I think you're

60
00:02:25,210 --> 00:02:31,180
even stronger trust your body because

61
00:02:28,629 --> 00:02:34,719
there's an imbalance of strength when

62
00:02:31,180 --> 00:02:37,740
it's all sympathetic when it's all male

63
00:02:34,719 --> 00:02:41,349
when it's all aggressive as opposed to

64
00:02:37,740 --> 00:02:44,500
parasympathetic without female tender

65
00:02:41,349 --> 00:02:47,139
that's the only yeah yeah then I'll

66
00:02:44,500 --> 00:02:49,990
synergize simple is all about that

67
00:02:47,139 --> 00:02:54,149
balance the old this whole thing our

68
00:02:49,990 --> 00:02:56,740
world has become so head oriented

69
00:02:54,150 --> 00:03:00,010
male-oriented penis more into depression

70
00:02:56,740 --> 00:03:02,530
oriented more oriented that there's kind

71
00:03:00,009 --> 00:03:04,719
of work or in vain our dysfunction is

72
00:03:02,530 --> 00:03:06,939
due to that in doubt so it's trusting

73
00:03:04,719 --> 00:03:10,569
<font color="#CCCCCC">it's yielding its</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> softly it's being</font>

74
00:03:06,939 --> 00:03:12,900
tender enough that allows deep grounded

75
00:03:10,569 --> 00:03:12,900
strength
