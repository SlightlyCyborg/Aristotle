00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,049
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay so we got a question</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> from our buddy</font>

2
00:00:01,560 --> 00:00:07,019
<font color="#CCCCCC">Johann who his father is in the hospital</font>

4
00:00:07,019 --> 00:00:13,289
gonna die pretty soon and<font color="#E5E5E5"> Johann cannot</font>

5
00:00:11,009 --> 00:00:15,298
bring himself to go to the hospital see

6
00:00:13,289 --> 00:00:18,179
his father because it hurts<font color="#E5E5E5"> him so much</font>

7
00:00:15,298 --> 00:00:21,509
he<font color="#E5E5E5"> gets really choked up he becomes</font>

8
00:00:18,179 --> 00:00:23,129
angry frustrated and he feels as if

9
00:00:21,510 --> 00:00:26,368
going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> visit his father just makes</font>

10
00:00:23,129 --> 00:00:27,570
things worse for him and he won't go and

11
00:00:26,368 --> 00:00:30,599
<font color="#E5E5E5">visit him he goes and sees his father</font>

12
00:00:27,570 --> 00:00:31,768
and you know his father can't speak so

13
00:00:30,599 --> 00:00:34,020
he's just<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of like laying there</font>

14
00:00:31,768 --> 00:00:35,549
looking at<font color="#E5E5E5"> him and it just makes you</font>

15
00:00:34,020 --> 00:00:38,670
<font color="#E5E5E5">want uncomfortable but he feels guilty</font>

16
00:00:35,549 --> 00:00:40,078
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know he's like I want to and it</font>

17
00:00:38,670 --> 00:00:43,289
truly it seems as if he loves his father

18
00:00:40,079 --> 00:00:45,929
but the pain is just too great what does

19
00:00:43,289 --> 00:00:49,109
he<font color="#E5E5E5"> do things days and weeks are going by</font>

20
00:00:45,929 --> 00:00:54,149
and he's not seeing his father you know

21
00:00:49,109 --> 00:00:55,679
<font color="#E5E5E5">Johan my concern more is more for you</font>

22
00:00:54,149 --> 00:00:57,660
than actually it is for<font color="#E5E5E5"> your father</font>

23
00:00:55,679 --> 00:00:59,369
because he is going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to pass like I said</font>

24
00:00:57,659 --> 00:01:02,909
he's going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> die but you're going to</font>

25
00:00:59,369 --> 00:01:05,308
live with the guilt of not sharing this

26
00:01:02,909 --> 00:01:08,938
time with him for the rest of<font color="#E5E5E5"> your life</font>

27
00:01:05,308 --> 00:01:10,618
if you<font color="#CCCCCC"> don't and even though it's</font>

28
00:01:08,938 --> 00:01:13,519
uncomfortable for you<font color="#E5E5E5"> to show up there</font>

29
00:01:10,618 --> 00:01:17,009
and be<font color="#CCCCCC"> with</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> him just for a few moments</font>

30
00:01:13,519 --> 00:01:18,599
you need to get over<font color="#E5E5E5"> it okay that's the</font>

31
00:01:17,009 --> 00:01:20,310
first thing and it's easier said than

32
00:01:18,599 --> 00:01:23,069
done so I'm going to afford you just an

33
00:01:20,310 --> 00:01:26,700
alternative idea i would say the first

34
00:01:23,069 --> 00:01:27,929
thing is just dude go and cry ball you

35
00:01:26,700 --> 00:01:30,150
<font color="#E5E5E5">know all the uncomfortable feelings that</font>

36
00:01:27,930 --> 00:01:33,090
you're getting are merely a form of

37
00:01:30,150 --> 00:01:36,000
dissonance it's the resistance against

38
00:01:33,090 --> 00:01:38,939
you actually letting out that which is

39
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:41,340
bubbling up in your body so a real man

40
00:01:38,938 --> 00:01:45,298
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> when I say a real man I mean someone</font>

41
00:01:41,340 --> 00:01:47,820
who's grounded in their actions<font color="#E5E5E5"> would go</font>

42
00:01:45,299 --> 00:01:50,189
and see his father and just if<font color="#E5E5E5"> he looks</font>

43
00:01:47,819 --> 00:01:53,789
<font color="#E5E5E5">at you with that I'm gonna die and miss</font>

44
00:01:50,188 --> 00:01:56,879
you son look cry just ball just hug him

45
00:01:53,790 --> 00:02:00,000
and cry and ball and leave it all right

46
00:01:56,879 --> 00:02:03,209
there on the hospital bed it's going to

47
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:05,069
<font color="#E5E5E5">be so cathartic in so many levels and it</font>

48
00:02:03,209 --> 00:02:07,379
<font color="#E5E5E5">will free you from the guilt of having</font>

49
00:02:05,069 --> 00:02:10,679
to live with never expressing this with

50
00:02:07,379 --> 00:02:13,169
him he's going to pass he will be okay

51
00:02:10,679 --> 00:02:15,479
you are going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be in pain for a very</font>

52
00:02:13,169 --> 00:02:19,649
long time if you don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> do this if you</font>

53
00:02:15,479 --> 00:02:24,419
can't bring yourself to doing this the

54
00:02:19,650 --> 00:02:26,310
other option would be to write to write

55
00:02:24,419 --> 00:02:29,218
to him every night before you go to bed

56
00:02:26,310 --> 00:02:31,848
<font color="#E5E5E5">pull</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> out pad and pen and you write out</font>

57
00:02:29,218 --> 00:02:35,638
everything and this may even be more

58
00:02:31,848 --> 00:02:38,548
impactful because you can when you<font color="#E5E5E5"> write</font>

59
00:02:35,639 --> 00:02:41,099
you actually take the time to embody

60
00:02:38,549 --> 00:02:43,079
your feelings with words words or

61
00:02:41,098 --> 00:02:46,048
symbols that represent abstract ideas

62
00:02:43,079 --> 00:02:47,730
and feelings so by writing it out you

63
00:02:46,049 --> 00:02:51,239
<font color="#E5E5E5">can actually come</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to greater grips with</font>

64
00:02:47,729 --> 00:02:53,969
what's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> on and then</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> also he will</font>

65
00:02:51,239 --> 00:02:55,849
feel peaceful knowing<font color="#CCCCCC"> that his son is</font>

66
00:02:53,969 --> 00:02:58,500
with him even though<font color="#E5E5E5"> he isn't with him</font>

67
00:02:55,848 --> 00:03:00,060
share those letters with him you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know if</font>

68
00:02:58,500 --> 00:03:02,699
you go there<font color="#CCCCCC"> and it's just too tough to</font>

69
00:03:00,060 --> 00:03:04,169
take or and you just hand him the letter

70
00:03:02,699 --> 00:03:06,988
and you walk out maybe someone else

71
00:03:04,169 --> 00:03:08,790
could read it to him or<font color="#CCCCCC"> if you just give</font>

72
00:03:06,989 --> 00:03:11,519
it to someone and say here place to take

73
00:03:08,789 --> 00:03:13,168
us to<font color="#E5E5E5"> my father apologize for to him for</font>

74
00:03:11,519 --> 00:03:16,199
<font color="#CCCCCC">me not being</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> there but he will get the</font>

75
00:03:13,169 --> 00:03:18,840
<font color="#CCCCCC">opportunity to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> read it and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you will be</font>

76
00:03:16,199 --> 00:03:22,159
free from the burden of carrying all of

77
00:03:18,840 --> 00:03:26,039
the emotion associated with a painful

78
00:03:22,158 --> 00:03:28,918
loss of your father or losing thereof so

79
00:03:26,039 --> 00:03:31,650
that's it either way it's more a form of

80
00:03:28,919 --> 00:03:34,260
catharsis for you it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> more of a way of</font>

81
00:03:31,650 --> 00:03:37,319
<font color="#E5E5E5">for you to get out what's happening in</font>

82
00:03:34,259 --> 00:03:40,728
you because that suppression that moral

83
00:03:37,318 --> 00:03:44,158
judgment or that restriction of your own

84
00:03:40,729 --> 00:03:47,040
emotion hurts you physiologically

85
00:03:44,158 --> 00:03:48,719
physically mentally and it will hurt you

86
00:03:47,039 --> 00:03:50,969
for a long time because of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the guilt</font>

87
00:03:48,719 --> 00:03:54,859
associated with<font color="#CCCCCC"> doing that you got to</font>

88
00:03:50,969 --> 00:03:54,859
<font color="#CCCCCC">get it out good luck</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> buddy</font>
