<font color="#E5E5E5">to make something out</font>

56
00:02:13,710 --> 00:02:18,540
nothing especially when it comes to an

57
00:02:15,960 --> 00:02:20,219
entrepreneurial venture you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> trying</font>

58
00:02:18,539 --> 00:02:22,019
<font color="#CCCCCC">to create a product that you want to</font>

59
00:02:20,219 --> 00:02:24,509
sell you wanted to create clothing for

60
00:02:22,020 --> 00:02:26,370

144
00:05:50,579 --> 00:05:54,089

00:06:04,019 --> 00:06:07,799
environment that allowed creativity that

153
00:06:06,029 --> 00:06:09,959
would that would have created or allowed

154
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:11,850
me to create my old opportunities right

155
00:06:09,959 --> 00:06:13,139

156
00:06:11,850 --> 00:06:14,460
you're not an entrepreneur and you're
