00:00:01,800 --> 00:00:06,028
that you<font color="#E5E5E5"> could read down below I speak</font>

3
00:00:03,870 --> 00:00:08,400
about five ways that strength training

4
00:00:06,028 --> 00:00:11,669
training with barbells dumbbells and

5
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:12,960
weights saved my life<font color="#CCCCCC"> now many of you</font>

6
00:00:11,669 --> 00:00:16,618
<font color="#E5E5E5">guys know that I've been</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> training since</font>

7
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:19,350
I was 14 years old I'm 36 now so that's

8
00:00:16,618 --> 00:00:21,929
well over two decades of training being

9
00:00:19,350 --> 00:00:24,029
under<font color="#CCCCCC"> the bar challenging myself with</font>

10
00:00:21,929 --> 00:00:26,429
heavier weights building muscle playing

11
00:00:24,028 --> 00:00:28,948
sports all<font color="#CCCCCC"> the things</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> related to growing</font>

12
00:00:26,429 --> 00:00:31,678
stronger physically I began<font color="#E5E5E5"> doing when I</font>

13
00:00:28,949 --> 00:00:33,239
was<font color="#E5E5E5"> 14 years old when my uncle became a</font>

14
00:00:31,678 --> 00:00:36,689
personal trainer and started training my

15
00:00:33,238 --> 00:00:38,878
brothers and I in<font color="#E5E5E5"> my parents basement 14</font>

16
00:00:36,689 --> 00:00:41,968
years old is a critical time<font color="#CCCCCC"> in fact</font>

17
00:00:38,878 --> 00:00:44,390
<font color="#E5E5E5">that's like you know your first</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> your</font>

18
00:00:41,969 --> 00:00:47,550
dipping your toe into the water of

19
00:00:44,390 --> 00:00:49,939
adulthood or adolescence because you

20
00:00:47,549 --> 00:00:53,069
know you're not so<font color="#CCCCCC"> much a kid anymore</font>

21
00:00:49,939 --> 00:00:55,488
but you're also not so much an adult and

22
00:00:53,070 --> 00:00:59,609
<font color="#E5E5E5">I think it's a perfect</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> opportunity to</font>

23
00:00:55,488 --> 00:01:04,018
<font color="#E5E5E5">give initiation and a sense of hope and</font>

24
00:00:59,609 --> 00:01:05,609
a sense of<font color="#CCCCCC"> destiny to young people by</font>

25
00:01:04,019 --> 00:01:08,130
offering them something that they can

26
00:01:05,609 --> 00:01:10,140
immerse all of their their vital

27
00:01:08,129 --> 00:01:12,118
resources and sexual energy that's

28
00:01:10,140 --> 00:01:14,340
coming up at<font color="#E5E5E5"> that particular time in</font>

29
00:01:12,118 --> 00:01:17,040
life because otherwise I know for<font color="#E5E5E5"> myself</font>

30
00:01:14,340 --> 00:01:21,090
when I<font color="#E5E5E5"> was 14 years old had I not found</font>

31
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:24,060
the sport of football but in<font color="#E5E5E5"> particular</font>

32
00:01:21,090 --> 00:01:26,340
the activity of weight training<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

33
00:01:24,060 --> 00:01:28,500
support my ability<font color="#CCCCCC"> to get stronger for</font>

34
00:01:26,340 --> 00:01:31,439
football I would have ventured down a

35
00:01:28,500 --> 00:01:33,868
path that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I was already started on which</font>

36
00:01:31,438 --> 00:01:37,019
included being arrested getting<font color="#E5E5E5"> into</font>

37
00:01:33,868 --> 00:01:39,930
fights stealing doing drugs and<font color="#E5E5E5"> a lot</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

38
00:01:37,019 --> 00:01:42,390
shit that 14 year old boys who don't

39
00:01:39,930 --> 00:01:44,880
have an outlet or somewhere to focus

40
00:01:42,390 --> 00:01:46,890
their the aggressive energy that's

41
00:01:44,879 --> 00:01:50,938
coming up in<font color="#E5E5E5"> their bodies would have</font>

42
00:01:46,890 --> 00:01:55,859
ultimately ended up being you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> lots</font>

43
00:01:50,938 --> 00:02:00,029
of gangs and drug dealing and you know

44
00:01:55,859 --> 00:02:01,799
all these ways of unruly tend to come up

45
00:02:00,030 --> 00:02:07,739
for young men around the ages

46
00:02:01,799 --> 00:02:10,650
14 16 17 were avoided in me averted

47
00:02:07,739 --> 00:02:12,900
because<font color="#E5E5E5"> I was able to take my energy</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

48
00:02:10,650 --> 00:02:15,090
focus it towards weight training by the

49
00:02:12,900 --> 00:02:17,219
blessing of my uncle and my parents were

50
00:02:15,090 --> 00:02:19,080
buying the barbell when I was 14 years

51
00:02:17,219 --> 00:02:21,629
old so today I'm going to talk about

52
00:02:19,080 --> 00:02:23,010
five different<font color="#E5E5E5"> ways that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> shun</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> training</font>

53
00:02:21,629 --> 00:02:24,629
has supported me<font color="#E5E5E5"> the very first</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> one</font>

54
00:02:23,009 --> 00:02:26,759
would say keep me out of trouble<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

55
00:02:24,629 --> 00:02:28,769
mentioned that just now a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of energy</font>

56
00:02:26,759 --> 00:02:31,949
and it was great<font color="#E5E5E5"> to focus it on</font>

57
00:02:28,770 --> 00:02:34,380
something productive rather than beating

58
00:02:31,949 --> 00:02:37,530
up more people and getting enough in the

59
00:02:34,379 --> 00:02:43,939
fights<font color="#E5E5E5"> and stealing things the next one</font>

60
00:02:37,530 --> 00:02:46,680
is my experience<font color="#CCCCCC"> of sowing and reaping</font>

61
00:02:43,939 --> 00:02:48,689
now you understand that's a principle<font color="#E5E5E5"> i</font>

62
00:02:46,680 --> 00:02:51,990
think brian<font color="#E5E5E5"> tracy once called it the law</font>

63
00:02:48,689 --> 00:02:54,300
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the farm meaning if</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you don't put in</font>

64
00:02:51,990 --> 00:02:55,860
the sea you don't put it in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the time you</font>

65
00:02:54,300 --> 00:02:59,939
<font color="#E5E5E5">don't put in the effort you don't put it</font>

66
00:02:55,860 --> 00:03:02,190
into patients you have no heels there's

67
00:02:59,939 --> 00:03:05,579
no gains and for<font color="#CCCCCC"> the first time in my</font>

68
00:03:02,189 --> 00:03:07,919
life did<font color="#E5E5E5"> I experience the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> act of putting</font>

70
00:03:07,919 --> 00:03:13,109
work in order<font color="#E5E5E5"> to have something on the</font>

71
00:03:10,590 --> 00:03:15,000
other end to be fruitive my works to be

72
00:03:13,110 --> 00:03:16,920
fruitive was never a very good student

73
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:20,069
so studying for a test didn't really

74
00:03:16,919 --> 00:03:24,479
help me that<font color="#CCCCCC"> much but</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> lifting barbells</font>

75
00:03:20,069 --> 00:03:27,419
all of a sudden gave me the results<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

76
00:03:24,479 --> 00:03:29,399
came from hard work it<font color="#E5E5E5"> was the first</font>

77
00:03:27,419 --> 00:03:34,039
time I was able to to put the two

78
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:37,709
together right hard work equals results

79
00:03:34,039 --> 00:03:39,299
<font color="#E5E5E5">focus concentration smart work equals</font>

00:03:37,709 --> 00:03:42,120
results<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's number two number three</font>

81
00:03:39,300 --> 00:03:46,110
chef training gave me the sword by which

82
00:03:42,120 --> 00:03:48,000
I carved out my life I was able to get

83
00:03:46,110 --> 00:03:49,380
<font color="#E5E5E5">an athletic scholarship playing football</font>

84
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:51,060
because I was so<font color="#E5E5E5"> much bigger stronger</font>

85
00:03:49,379 --> 00:03:52,949
and faster than many of the other

86
00:03:51,060 --> 00:03:55,020
athletes my size<font color="#E5E5E5"> and in my position</font>

87
00:03:52,949 --> 00:03:59,579
playing the sport<font color="#CCCCCC"> sport of football</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

88
00:03:55,020 --> 00:04:01,469
<font color="#CCCCCC">I also experienced what it was like to</font>

89
00:03:59,580 --> 00:04:04,050
be coached and I knew immediately<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

90
00:04:01,469 --> 00:04:05,699
that's what I wanted<font color="#CCCCCC"> to do when my uncle</font>

91
00:04:04,050 --> 00:04:07,769
coached me when my football coaches

92
00:04:05,699 --> 00:04:10,259
coached me when my strength coaches

93
00:04:07,769 --> 00:04:13,400
coach to me when my mentors in the

94
00:04:10,259 --> 00:04:17,029
profession of fitness and ensuring

95
00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:19,399
coached me<font color="#E5E5E5"> I was able to absorb all of</font>

their professional skills and<font color="#E5E5E5"> find a</font>

broke profession for myself a vocation

98
00:04:22,009 --> 00:04:28,850
for myself so all my coaching at<font color="#CCCCCC"> the gym</font>

99
00:04:24,860 --> 00:04:31,038
strengthcamp videos blogs anything

100
00:04:28,850 --> 00:04:35,090
related to being able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to put food on my</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">table came as a result of being shown</font>

102
00:04:35,089 --> 00:04:40,069
and handed a barbell when I was 14 years

103
00:04:37,759 --> 00:04:41,600
old number<font color="#CCCCCC"> 4 I was a better student</font>

104
00:04:40,069 --> 00:04:44,360
because I really didn't care<font color="#E5E5E5"> too much</font>

105
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:45,650
about tracking and testing and reading

106
00:04:44,360 --> 00:04:48,439
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> journaling and things of that nature</font>

107
00:04:45,649 --> 00:04:51,620
until I started tracking testing

108
00:04:48,439 --> 00:04:55,339
studying and journaling my results in

109
00:04:51,620 --> 00:05:00,860
the gym never<font color="#E5E5E5"> before did I take up such</font>

110
00:04:55,339 --> 00:05:02,119
a cadet academic work until I started

111
00:05:00,860 --> 00:05:04,610
training with the barbell this is my

112
00:05:02,120 --> 00:05:08,840
very<font color="#E5E5E5"> first trading</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Journal you can see</font>

113
00:05:04,610 --> 00:05:13,250
here where it says<font color="#E5E5E5"> 1994 1995 even 96 and</font>

114
00:05:08,839 --> 00:05:16,098
I began keeping notes of my workouts I

115
00:05:13,250 --> 00:05:18,470
began keeping records of my the weights

116
00:05:16,098 --> 00:05:21,168
lifted I began tracking my body weight I

117
00:05:18,470 --> 00:05:22,910
began planning for the future that's a

118
00:05:21,168 --> 00:05:25,149
really important one you know so for

119
00:05:22,910 --> 00:05:28,130
example<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is a six to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> 12 week program</font>

120
00:05:25,149 --> 00:05:30,709
never before that I think 12 weeks ahead

121
00:05:28,129 --> 00:05:32,449
when I'm 14 years old you're not

122
00:05:30,709 --> 00:05:35,120
thinking what's happening three months

123
00:05:32,449 --> 00:05:38,900
<font color="#E5E5E5">from now but when I was handed a barbell</font>

124
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:41,300
I began thinking hmm three months<font color="#CCCCCC"> six</font>

125
00:05:38,899 --> 00:05:43,609
<font color="#E5E5E5">months a year from now where my ID who</font>

126
00:05:41,300 --> 00:05:47,180
might I become if I put in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the effort</font>

127
00:05:43,610 --> 00:05:49,580
the time and the concentration to build

128
00:05:47,180 --> 00:05:51,800
my body methodically through weight

129
00:05:49,579 --> 00:05:53,870
training so there's so much more than

130
00:05:51,800 --> 00:05:55,520
just my physical growth it was also<font color="#CCCCCC"> my</font>

131
00:05:53,870 --> 00:05:59,750
intellectual mental growth and then

132
00:05:55,519 --> 00:06:02,000
finally my heart's growth my soul weight

133
00:05:59,750 --> 00:06:05,689
training<font color="#E5E5E5"> opened my mind and opened my</font>

00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:10,370
heart to the<font color="#E5E5E5"> fat and my personal</font>

135
00:06:05,689 --> 00:06:14,389
experience that what I do who I become

136
00:06:10,370 --> 00:06:16,610
the activities I engage in and how they

137
00:06:14,389 --> 00:06:19,550
impact the lives of others<font color="#CCCCCC"> I began to</font>

138
00:06:16,610 --> 00:06:21,830
realize<font color="#E5E5E5"> that the stronger I had become</font>

139
00:06:19,550 --> 00:06:24,379
not just physically but as i shared

140
00:06:21,829 --> 00:06:25,128
mentally the better prepared<font color="#CCCCCC"> i was to</font>

141
00:06:24,379 --> 00:06:27,288
deal with the challenge

142
00:06:25,129 --> 00:06:30,050
of the world and specifically dealings

143
00:06:27,288 --> 00:06:32,918
in relationships when you subject

144

yourself to an<font color="#CCCCCC"> activity that requires</font>
