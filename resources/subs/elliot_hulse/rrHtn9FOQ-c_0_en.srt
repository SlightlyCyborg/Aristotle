00:00:16,920 --> 00:00:20,580
to what's going on in my life right now

time that she and I really went<font color="#E5E5E5"> on a</font>

14
00:00:27,899 --> 00:00:32,070
vacation since getting married over 10

15
00:00:30,449 --> 00:00:33,899
years ago we've been having children and

16

taking<font color="#E5E5E5"> care of children for the past</font>

00:00:33,899 --> 00:00:37,200
eight years my oldest daughter is eight

18
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:39,149
<font color="#E5E5E5">and it was the first time that we</font>

19
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:41,250
actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> got a way to do something for</font>

20
00:00:39,149 --> 00:00:43,558
longer than you know a day or<font color="#E5E5E5"> two by</font>

21
00:00:41,250 --> 00:00:44,700
ourselves so it was great but<font color="#CCCCCC"> that the</font>

22
00:00:43,558 --> 00:00:47,009
reason why I'm making this video<font color="#E5E5E5"> is not</font>

23
00:00:44,700 --> 00:00:51,390
just<font color="#E5E5E5"> to give you further insight into</font>

24
00:00:47,009 --> 00:00:53,878
the makings of my life but to make sure

25
00:00:51,390 --> 00:00:56,789
that the experiences that I have not

26
00:00:53,878 --> 00:00:58,049
only teach me lessons but also support

27
00:00:56,789 --> 00:00:59,370
you in your journey of becoming the

28
00:00:58,049 --> 00:01:02,038
strongest version yourself that's why I

29
00:00:59,369 --> 00:01:06,509
do this<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know it's not because I'm a</font>

30
00:01:02,039 --> 00:01:08,790
genius or I have some grand message that

31
00:01:06,510 --> 00:01:10,200
needs to be shared the deal is<font color="#CCCCCC"> that I'm</font>

32
00:01:08,790 --> 00:01:12,390
on this<font color="#E5E5E5"> journey of becoming a stronger</font>

33
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:14,130
version of myself grow stronger inspire

34
00:01:12,390 --> 00:01:16,049
others when<font color="#E5E5E5"> you see me</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> in these videos</font>

35
00:01:14,129 --> 00:01:18,209
it's just me fulfilling that other half

36
00:01:16,049 --> 00:01:19,950
of my mission is to<font color="#E5E5E5"> inspire others and</font>

37
00:01:18,209 --> 00:01:22,649
hopefully some<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the things that happen</font>

38
00:01:19,950 --> 00:01:24,450
my life might be resourceful to you and

39
00:01:22,650 --> 00:01:26,130
that may be the reason why you stuck

40
00:01:24,450 --> 00:01:27,840
around this long otherwise if<font color="#CCCCCC"> you think</font>

41
00:01:26,129 --> 00:01:31,469
I'm you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> full of shit I've been</font>

42
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:33,680
called quack and charlatans<font color="#CCCCCC"> and snake</font>

00:01:31,469 --> 00:01:36,359
oil<font color="#CCCCCC"> salesman if any of those titles</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> seem</font>

44
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:38,909
legit when describing me then<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're</font>

45
00:01:36,359 --> 00:01:41,009
probably not here and and if you know

46
00:01:38,909 --> 00:01:42,780
that's what you feel about me then maybe

47
00:01:41,009 --> 00:01:45,030
I'm just a<font color="#CCCCCC"> good-looking guy that you</font>

48
00:01:42,780 --> 00:01:47,790
like<font color="#E5E5E5"> to watch on video so anyway I</font>

49
00:01:45,030 --> 00:01:49,049
decide that I want to share an

50
00:01:47,790 --> 00:01:51,450
experience that I had when we weren't

51
00:01:49,049 --> 00:01:53,520
American Republic the last day that

52
00:01:51,450 --> 00:01:55,500
we've last full day that we were there

53
00:01:53,519 --> 00:01:56,819
went scuba diving right and I fucking

54
00:01:55,500 --> 00:01:59,310
should know better because I can't swim

55
00:01:56,819 --> 00:02:00,779
I might pretend like I can swim my

56
00:01:59,310 --> 00:02:02,189
daughter shows me in a breast stroke but

57
00:02:00,780 --> 00:02:04,019

58
00:02:02,188 --> 00:02:05,758
<font color="#E5E5E5">like come to grips with that it's always</font>

59
00:02:04,019 --> 00:02:07,789
<font color="#E5E5E5">been this way the other kids just made</font>

62
00:02:10,618 --> 00:02:13,229

63
00:02:11,879 --> 00:02:16,650
Beckett swim I even put<font color="#E5E5E5"> on like a little</font>

66
00:02:19,889 --> 00:02:26,250
I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> drinking all types of water i'm</font>

67
00:02:22,379 --> 00:02:28,769
sucking in a<font color="#CCCCCC"> haha</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> caribbean saltwater</font>

68
00:02:26,250 --> 00:02:31,680
with whatever infested you know

69
00:02:28,770 --> 00:02:35,580
parasites funguses and pathogens<font color="#E5E5E5"> of all</font>

70
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:38,610
sorts so that night I was throwing<font color="#E5E5E5"> up</font>

71
00:02:35,580 --> 00:02:41,760
and shitting out both ends like never

72
00:02:38,610 --> 00:02:44,340
<font color="#E5E5E5">before my entire body was wrenching in</font>

73
00:02:41,759 --> 00:02:47,370
order to produce the vomit it was like

74
00:02:44,340 --> 00:02:49,830
the deep abdominal wall and the pelvic

75
00:02:47,370 --> 00:02:52,469
floor<font color="#E5E5E5"> contracting to such a degree that</font>

76
00:02:49,830 --> 00:02:55,800
it like propelled vomit up through my

77
00:02:52,469 --> 00:02:58,139
esophagus out of my mouth ridiculous

78
00:02:55,800 --> 00:03:00,300
right so sick really sick falling and

79
00:02:58,139 --> 00:03:02,579
then like in between vomits sitting on

80
00:03:00,300 --> 00:03:04,140
toilet and taking a shit which<font color="#CCCCCC"> it was</font>

81
00:03:02,580 --> 00:03:05,910
more like pissing out the ass so anyway

82
00:03:04,139 --> 00:03:10,859
so you get the severity of the situation

83
00:03:05,909 --> 00:03:12,689
it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> clear</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you right so I know unlike</font>

84
00:03:10,860 --> 00:03:14,310
<font color="#CCCCCC">most people that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> when you're in the</font>

85
00:03:12,689 --> 00:03:15,719
third world country and you get sick

86
00:03:14,310 --> 00:03:18,210
like that<font color="#E5E5E5"> even if it's just for a few</font>

87
00:03:15,719 --> 00:03:21,599
hours you had better get your shit

88
00:03:18,210 --> 00:03:25,560
tested because that's your body reacting

89
00:03:21,599 --> 00:03:26,759
to a parasite pathogen I don't know what

90
00:03:25,560 --> 00:03:28,650
kind<font color="#CCCCCC"> of could be</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a bacteria but a</font>

91
00:03:26,759 --> 00:03:32,549
pathogen of some sort and<font color="#CCCCCC"> often times</font>

92
00:03:28,650 --> 00:03:37,349
these especially<font color="#E5E5E5"> these</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> are warm water</font>

93
00:03:32,550 --> 00:03:39,660
warm climate pathogens they are they're

94
00:03:37,349 --> 00:03:41,759
<font color="#E5E5E5">Hardy so they get inside your digestive</font>

95
00:03:39,659 --> 00:03:45,150
system and they<font color="#E5E5E5"> leaving they're going to</font>

96
00:03:41,759 --> 00:03:47,759
hang out there and and Greek all types

97
00:03:45,150 --> 00:03:50,340
of havoc on your health you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know there</font>

98
00:03:47,759 --> 00:03:52,229
are<font color="#E5E5E5"> so many diseases that are that can</font>

99
00:03:50,340 --> 00:03:55,020
be linked back to oh<font color="#E5E5E5"> you've got a bug</font>

100
00:03:52,229 --> 00:03:56,429
shitting in your blood so think I'm

101
00:03:55,020 --> 00:03:57,810
crazy you think this stuff is like<font color="#E5E5E5"> off</font>

102
00:03:56,430 --> 00:03:58,980
<font color="#CCCCCC">the walls simply because the medical</font>

103
00:03:57,810 --> 00:04:00,479
industry doesn't want you to know it

104
00:03:58,979 --> 00:04:01,859
because you can't sell them very

105
00:04:00,479 --> 00:04:03,509
expensive drugs to get<font color="#E5E5E5"> rid of this shit</font>

106
00:04:01,860 --> 00:04:05,430
it's very hard to diagnosis so it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not</font>

107
00:04:03,509 --> 00:04:06,629
a good moneymaker so that's why most

108
00:04:05,430 --> 00:04:07,740
people you know here you're talking

109
00:04:06,629 --> 00:04:09,629
about parasites and they<font color="#CCCCCC"> think like</font>

110
00:04:07,740 --> 00:04:12,030
<font color="#E5E5E5">you're getting you out of your mind but</font>

111
00:04:09,629 --> 00:04:13,289
if you understand<font color="#E5E5E5"> what i understand you</font>

112
00:04:12,030 --> 00:04:14,640
realize most people are sick and<font color="#E5E5E5"> they</font>

113
00:04:13,289 --> 00:04:16,769
don't know why they're sick<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is one</font>

114
00:04:14,639 --> 00:04:18,750
of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the many reasons</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so you get tested</font>

115
00:04:16,769 --> 00:04:21,930
<font color="#CCCCCC">and that's the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> point</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that I'm trying</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

116
00:04:18,750 --> 00:04:23,939
<font color="#E5E5E5">make next is that uh as soon</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> as I got</font>

117
00:04:21,930 --> 00:04:24,990
<font color="#E5E5E5">home for me and my wife because she got</font>

118
00:04:23,939 --> 00:04:27,839
sick<font color="#E5E5E5"> also</font>

119
00:04:24,990 --> 00:04:29,759
<font color="#CCCCCC">I called dr.</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> kaylis she's my naturopath</font>

120
00:04:27,839 --> 00:04:31,500
right away I've taken courses in fact

121
00:04:29,759 --> 00:04:33,569
I've taken advanced courses with dr.

122
00:04:31,500 --> 00:04:36,120
<font color="#E5E5E5">kaylis and my brother and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I are actually</font>

123
00:04:33,569 --> 00:04:40,289
going to bring you a course all about

124
00:04:36,120 --> 00:04:43,228
what I learned through him so needless

125
00:04:40,288 --> 00:04:44,818
to say he's my go-to guy when it<font color="#E5E5E5"> comes</font>

126
00:04:43,228 --> 00:04:46,318
to physiological strength because this

127
00:04:44,819 --> 00:04:47,848
is physiological strength if you your

128
00:04:46,319 --> 00:04:48,960
physiology isn't strong your body's<font color="#CCCCCC"> not</font>

129
00:04:47,848 --> 00:04:50,459
going to be strong and<font color="#CCCCCC"> I knew my</font>

130
00:04:48,959 --> 00:04:54,750
physiology was compromised by this

131
00:04:50,459 --> 00:04:57,299
pathogen so today got home and we both

132
00:04:54,750 --> 00:05:01,470
Colleen and I we ordered a what are

133
00:04:57,300 --> 00:05:03,060
called 401 H pathogen screens and

134
00:05:01,470 --> 00:05:04,620
they'll be coming in a couple days<font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

135

151
00:05:40,620 --> 00:05:44,639
using to get<font color="#E5E5E5"> rid of the unique pathogen</font>

152
00:05:42,750 --> 00:05:47,459
that i may or may not have<font color="#E5E5E5"> hopefully it</font>

153
00:05:44,639 --> 00:05:48,990
turns out that it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not a pathogen so</font>

154
00:05:47,459 --> 00:05:51,149
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> point here is just to give you guys</font>

155
00:05:48,990 --> 00:05:53,129
insight insight into my thinking process

156
00:05:51,149 --> 00:05:54,629
but also to the actions that I take

157
00:05:53,129 --> 00:05:56,370
associated with becoming<font color="#E5E5E5"> a stronger</font>

158
00:05:54,629 --> 00:05:59,189
version of myself<font color="#E5E5E5"> always talk about four</font>

159
00:05:56,370 --> 00:06:00,329
layers right so most people you know

160
00:05:59,189 --> 00:06:02,310
they get sick they want to come<font color="#E5E5E5"> back</font>

161
00:06:00,329 --> 00:06:03,959
home to<font color="#E5E5E5"> the gym and they want to like</font>

162
00:06:02,310 --> 00:06:06,209
pound the weights like start crushing

163
00:06:03,959 --> 00:06:08,430
heavy deadlifts and like burning out do

164
00:06:06,209 --> 00:06:10,649
pronounce sense for their side delts and

165
00:06:08,430 --> 00:06:12,030
shit like that get back in shape me I

166
00:06:10,649 --> 00:06:13,888
take<font color="#CCCCCC"> a more subtle approach because I</font>

167
00:06:12,029 --> 00:06:15,899
<font color="#CCCCCC">realized that all the muscle fucking</font>

168
00:06:13,889 --> 00:06:21,060
pumping in a whirling queer shit if you

169
00:06:15,899 --> 00:06:22,468
got bugs living in your gut right so see

170
00:06:21,060 --> 00:06:23,788
you understand my four layers of

171
00:06:22,468 --> 00:06:25,529
strength that much greater I wanted to

172
00:06:23,788 --> 00:06:27,899
share this<font color="#CCCCCC"> with you so that's it folks</font>

173
00:06:25,529 --> 00:06:29,519
i'll keep you posted if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> enjoy these</font>

174
00:06:27,899 --> 00:06:31,829
random rant videos like I'm doing right

175
00:06:29,519 --> 00:06:33,478
<font color="#CCCCCC">now let me know</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> because it takes you</font>

176
00:06:31,829 --> 00:06:36,269
know takes me stepping out of my comfort

177
00:06:33,478 --> 00:06:37,050
zone with my family and what<font color="#E5E5E5"> not to film</font>

178
00:06:36,269 --> 00:06:38,698
them

179
00:06:37,050 --> 00:06:41,819
and if you like them I'll make more

180
00:06:38,699 --> 00:06:47,930
otherwise like quite frankly<font color="#CCCCCC"> I got shit</font>

181
00:06:41,819 --> 00:06:47,930
to do kids to go feed<font color="#CCCCCC"> all right peace</font>
