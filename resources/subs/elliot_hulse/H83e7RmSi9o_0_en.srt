6
00:00:15,480 --> 00:00:20,609
fascinating today to see behind me

about being 90 thousand dollars in debt

00:00:31,649 --> 00:00:37,409
and that's only partially true a part of

14
00:00:34,439 --> 00:00:39,058
the part of what I was wrestling through

15
00:00:37,409 --> 00:00:41,459
when I first moved down to Florida was

16
00:00:39,058 --> 00:00:43,109
<font color="#E5E5E5">was trying to get out</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of a upside-down</font>

105
00:04:47,470 --> 00:04:54,250

00:05:02,269 --> 00:05:05,839
credit was so destroyed because of

111
00:05:04,339 --> 00:05:07,369
dealing with<font color="#E5E5E5"> the banks and that</font>

118
00:05:16,360 --> 00:05:22,040

outside<font color="#CCCCCC"> and getting some sunshine also</font>

121
00:05:25,189 --> 00:05:31,189
remind me of the fact that sunshine

122
00:05:28,569 --> 00:05:34,579
carries a tremendous amount of vital

123
00:05:31,189 --> 00:05:37,490
resource energy the Sun the Sun is what

124
00:05:34,579 --> 00:05:39,680
gives us<font color="#CCCCCC"> the life we live right without</font>

125
00:05:37,490 --> 00:05:42,110
the zombie we wouldn't exist<font color="#E5E5E5"> all this</font>

126
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:45,709
greenery I'm wearing green today all

127
00:05:42,110 --> 00:05:49,100
this greenery is<font color="#E5E5E5"> a byproduct of the Sun</font>

128
00:05:45,709 --> 00:05:50,689
making<font color="#E5E5E5"> its love its daily dose of love</font>

129
00:05:49,100 --> 00:05:53,990
giving its daily dose of love to<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

130
00:05:50,689 --> 00:05:56,660
earth and<font color="#CCCCCC"> the earth</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> provides its fruit</font>

131
00:05:53,990 --> 00:05:58,280
and we are a fruit of the earth we grow

132
00:05:56,660 --> 00:06:01,130
just like these plants grow without

133
00:05:58,279 --> 00:06:02,839
sunshine we don't grow nearly as healthy

134
00:06:01,129 --> 00:06:03,860
as these plants would you know like

135
00:06:02,839 --> 00:06:05,899
these plants they wouldn't grow<font color="#E5E5E5"> if</font>

they've been<font color="#E5E5E5"> getting sunshine sunshine</font>

137
00:06:05,899 --> 00:06:14,138
brings us the<font color="#E5E5E5"> plan to eat animals we eat</font>

brain and nervous system development and

196
00:08:32,538 --> 00:08:36,918
not only that when I looked deeper and

197
00:08:34,639 --> 00:08:39,740
started studying the work of Weston a

198
00:08:36,918 --> 00:08:42,379
price he showed how in traditional

00:08:49,639 --> 00:08:54,939
highly sought after in fact there were

204
00:08:51,500 --> 00:08:59,389
certain traditional cultures who would

205
00:08:54,940 --> 00:09:02,060
send they would go out an expedition to
