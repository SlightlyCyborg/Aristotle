00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,690
where

2
00:00:09,609 --> 00:00:16,149
everything I'm learning<font color="#E5E5E5"> in my life is</font>

3
00:00:12,730 --> 00:00:18,969
starting<font color="#CCCCCC"> to question what I've learned</font>

4
00:00:16,149 --> 00:00:22,809
my whole life I like<font color="#E5E5E5"> to follow that and</font>

5
00:00:18,969 --> 00:00:26,009
go matter George Karl and keep George

6
00:00:22,809 --> 00:00:26,009
Carlin the guy vs

7
00:00:27,359 --> 00:00:33,229
I modulus big and when

8
00:00:34,469 --> 00:00:42,270
and is there a<font color="#E5E5E5"> middle ground or somebody</font>

00:00:38,890 --> 00:00:42,270
s<font color="#CCCCCC"> paid and suffering</font>

10
00:00:43,399 --> 00:00:47,439
so is there any<font color="#E5E5E5"> sort</font>

11
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:55,590
I've<font color="#E5E5E5"> been using this metaphor with dance</font>

12
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:58,950
right

13
00:00:55,590 --> 00:01:02,950
the dance is the physical expression of

14
00:00:58,950 --> 00:01:07,799
rhythm rhythm is music

15
00:01:02,950 --> 00:01:07,799
there's no linear music it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> always</font>

16
00:01:08,739 --> 00:01:13,209
up down down up down left right left

17
00:01:10,659 --> 00:01:18,100
right left right you see so there's a

18
00:01:13,209 --> 00:01:22,019
duality the entire universe<font color="#CCCCCC"> all of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font>

24
00:01:36,969 --> 00:01:43,149
what's this duel shit going on if you

25
00:01:40,450 --> 00:01:46,929
look around everywhere like down<font color="#CCCCCC"> to that</font>

26
00:01:43,149 --> 00:01:48,819
atoms protons neutrons like how is it

27
00:01:46,929 --> 00:01:52,000
that there is this plus and minus<font color="#E5E5E5"> going</font>

28
00:01:48,819 --> 00:01:59,590
on everywhere right it makes you wonder

29
00:01:52,000 --> 00:02:03,688
if there's<font color="#CCCCCC"> only one way well if there is</font>

where where there's heaven in hell we're

inviting you to explore is religion yes

37
00:02:33,199 --> 00:02:42,119
logic guests dance they both support

each other if you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> keen enough to see</font>

39
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:49,680
if you watch a lot of it is interesting

40
00:02:46,409 --> 00:02:52,530
because it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> remastered eyes din to a</font>

and you end up<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the same fucking place</font>

45
00:03:02,009 --> 00:03:06,959
they're just speaking different

51
00:03:18,300 --> 00:03:22,500
so diametrically opposed penis vagina

52
00:03:20,099 --> 00:03:25,500
they don't look anything alike what

53
00:03:22,500 --> 00:03:35,189
happens when it come together baby power

54
00:03:25,500 --> 00:03:42,810
shit there's different and you believe

killing his poetry dizzy there's this

61
00:04:00,479 --> 00:04:07,079
advice of this and we're spreading apart

62
00:04:03,180 --> 00:04:10,140
we're saying that it's it's one and not

63
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:12,360
another when really that's the biggest

64
00:04:10,139 --> 00:04:13,769
lie we've been told it's so funny

65
00:04:12,360 --> 00:04:19,049
because I love this porch of this whole

66
00:04:13,770 --> 00:04:25,019
of Genesis familiar with Genesis there

67
00:04:19,048 --> 00:04:26,729
was paradise Adam<font color="#E5E5E5"> II paradise they</font>

68
00:04:25,019 --> 00:04:29,639
didn't know that<font color="#CCCCCC"> they</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> were separate from</font>

69
00:04:26,730 --> 00:04:32,819
God which<font color="#E5E5E5"> basically means it was an Adam</font>

70
00:04:29,639 --> 00:04:37,769
Eve right it's everything was what it

71
00:04:32,819 --> 00:04:40,560
was peaceful shit was perfect the minute

72
00:04:37,769 --> 00:04:42,418
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> they rarely night it might mind you</font>

73
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:44,620
they eat from the tree of wisdom why is

74
00:04:42,418 --> 00:04:48,519
it<font color="#E5E5E5"> that it's called the tree with</font>

75
00:04:44,620 --> 00:04:51,610
why is<font color="#E5E5E5"> it a snake always if you notice</font>

76
00:04:48,519 --> 00:04:53,799
<font color="#E5E5E5">like Egyptian art it's always a sign of</font>

77
00:04:51,610 --> 00:04:56,169
wisdom so there's a snake there's a

78
00:04:53,800 --> 00:04:58,418
creature of wisdom in mythology the

79
00:04:56,168 --> 00:05:02,439
snake<font color="#CCCCCC"> ohs</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> represents wisdom they're</font>

80
00:04:58,418 --> 00:05:04,389
eating from a tree of wisdom and the

81
00:05:02,439 --> 00:05:09,100
very<font color="#E5E5E5"> first</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> thing that happens when</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> they</font>

82
00:05:04,389 --> 00:05:12,250
bite that Apple penis vagina they

83
00:05:09,100 --> 00:05:17,080
recognize their separation we've<font color="#E5E5E5"> lost</font>

84
00:05:12,250 --> 00:05:19,449
paradise because we gain<font color="#CCCCCC"> the wisdom and</font>

85
00:05:17,079 --> 00:05:24,149
this is why<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's wisdom because the</font>

86
00:05:19,449 --> 00:05:29,110
digital age is powered by penis vagina

87
00:05:24,149 --> 00:05:31,509
01 you see so this is this recognition

88
00:05:29,110 --> 00:05:34,720
<font color="#E5E5E5">of Adam and Eve instead of a believe or</font>

89
00:05:31,509 --> 00:05:37,599
their separation from God that causes

90
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:39,850
<font color="#CCCCCC">all the shit like Cain killed Abel and</font>

91
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:41,590
now we're all screwed i mean we're

92
00:05:39,850 --> 00:05:43,289
killing each other left and right y de

93
00:05:41,589 --> 00:05:45,939
que<font color="#CCCCCC"> el is brilliant fucking brothers</font>

94
00:05:43,288 --> 00:05:49,300
Cain had a different attitude Abel had a

95
00:05:45,939 --> 00:05:51,759
different attitude one was more of a

96
00:05:49,300 --> 00:05:55,418
cultivator of the land the other one was

97
00:05:51,759 --> 00:06:00,610
a<font color="#E5E5E5"> what they call it no man it's this</font>

98
00:05:55,418 --> 00:06:03,370
separation Cain killed Abel the<font color="#CCCCCC"> jews</font>

99
00:06:00,610 --> 00:06:05,139
killed or Muslims killed Richards

100
00:06:03,370 --> 00:06:07,180
Christians to the<font color="#E5E5E5"> Muslims to see</font>

101
00:06:05,139 --> 00:06:10,060
cannulated the same fucking shit they're

102
00:06:07,180 --> 00:06:15,009
both offspring of Adam Eve there who are

103
00:06:10,060 --> 00:06:20,490
both from paradise but they woke up<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

104
00:06:15,009 --> 00:06:21,819
that waking up is powerful but also our

105
00:06:20,490 --> 00:06:25,030
downfall

106
00:06:21,819 --> 00:06:30,399
how man has fallen they say the fall of

107
00:06:25,029 --> 00:06:32,819
man is because it's done<font color="#E5E5E5"> you get that</font>

108
00:06:30,399 --> 00:06:32,819
yeah

109
00:06:36,939 --> 00:06:47,810
but if you revive it again awesome

110
00:06:44,750 --> 00:06:48,439
right so by definition you're saying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

111
00:06:47,810 --> 00:06:51,810
another

112
00:06:48,439 --> 00:06:56,629
increase and also<font color="#E5E5E5"> has if you are</font>

113
00:06:51,810 --> 00:07:00,720
my definition and all these are stories

114
00:06:56,629 --> 00:07:02,550
to describe the undescribable to

115
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:07,500
represent that<font color="#E5E5E5"> which could never truly</font>

116
00:07:02,550 --> 00:07:09,710
<font color="#E5E5E5">be known so mythology or religion is</font>

117
00:07:07,500 --> 00:07:11,910
mythology whether in the term ethology

118
00:07:09,709 --> 00:07:14,399
don't get it twisted it doesn't mean

119
00:07:11,910 --> 00:07:16,200
<font color="#CCCCCC">that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it's a lie it's olive eight mints</font>

120
00:07:14,399 --> 00:07:18,569
don't mean<font color="#CCCCCC"> oh</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we come to believe that</font>

121
00:07:16,199 --> 00:07:23,610
<font color="#E5E5E5">when you say bit I shut the fucking bed</font>

122
00:07:18,569 --> 00:07:26,909
Oh careful because myth mythology<font color="#E5E5E5"> are</font>

123
00:07:23,610 --> 00:07:29,340
the powerful stories that we've used as

124
00:07:26,910 --> 00:07:33,419
a race of human beings since the dawn of

125
00:07:29,339 --> 00:07:38,399
creation or I use that operation but the

126
00:07:33,418 --> 00:07:42,060
<font color="#E5E5E5">Boeing up of people</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> here somehow we've</font>

127
00:07:38,399 --> 00:07:46,039
used it since the beginning to describe

128
00:07:42,060 --> 00:07:49,139
that which cannot be seen but we feel

129
00:07:46,040 --> 00:07:54,240
the way the mythology plays out is

130
00:07:49,139 --> 00:07:56,910
merely happenstance it's mere the Native

131
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:59,280
American merely happened to live amongst

132
00:07:56,910 --> 00:08:02,330
Buffalo so they've got<font color="#CCCCCC"> a buffalo guy</font>

133
00:07:59,279 --> 00:08:06,750
there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> no fucking Buffalo in Jerusalem</font>

134
00:08:02,329 --> 00:08:10,800
do you<font color="#E5E5E5"> see so what people end up</font>

135
00:08:06,750 --> 00:08:14,769
tangling with is my stories better than

136
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:17,050
your story when they all look if you go

137
00:08:14,769 --> 00:08:22,889
to the root of<font color="#E5E5E5"> all every</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> single one of</font>

138
00:08:17,050 --> 00:08:25,598
them it comes to the same thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> Italy</font>

139
00:08:22,889 --> 00:08:27,728
you got to be very detached very

140
00:08:25,598 --> 00:08:30,668
objective about this to accept what I'm

141
00:08:27,728 --> 00:08:35,918
saying<font color="#E5E5E5"> because what happens is we become</font>

142
00:08:30,668 --> 00:08:38,399
personally invested in our myth and any

143
00:08:35,918 --> 00:08:42,610
attack<font color="#E5E5E5"> on something that personally</font>

144
00:08:38,399 --> 00:08:45,429
invested in is an attack on me right

145
00:08:42,610 --> 00:08:48,310
science is a religion because it's just

146
00:08:45,429 --> 00:08:50,620
<font color="#CCCCCC">a story to describe the undescribable</font>

147
