1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,830
got a question from<font color="#E5E5E5"> one of our friends</font>

2
00:00:01,560 --> 00:00:07,048
who's got sort of a typical social

3
00:00:04,830 --> 00:00:10,949
anxiety situation going on but he's got

4
00:00:07,049 --> 00:00:13,289
a<font color="#CCCCCC"> a unique problem in that he wants eat</font>

5
00:00:10,949 --> 00:00:15,838
he's very good at what<font color="#E5E5E5"> he does he says</font>

6
00:00:13,289 --> 00:00:18,629
that he's developing his mastery in his

7
00:00:15,839 --> 00:00:20,490
field of work and he realizes or he's

8
00:00:18,629 --> 00:00:23,399
come to appreciate through my videos

9
00:00:20,489 --> 00:00:25,288
that by developing himself developing

10
00:00:23,399 --> 00:00:29,339
his mastery in this particular area at

11
00:00:25,289 --> 00:00:30,840
some point perhaps<font color="#CCCCCC"> the world will open</font>

12
00:00:29,339 --> 00:00:33,450
up to him and he will have the

13
00:00:30,839 --> 00:00:35,189
<font color="#CCCCCC">opportunity</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to meet friends and meet</font>

14
00:00:33,450 --> 00:00:37,680
people and meet women because right now

15
00:00:35,189 --> 00:00:39,988
it's the<font color="#CCCCCC"> situation is such that he can't</font>

16
00:00:37,679 --> 00:00:43,950
do any<font color="#E5E5E5"> of those things you know he he</font>

17
00:00:39,988 --> 00:00:45,570
has aggressively worked towards ridding

18
00:00:43,950 --> 00:00:47,399
himself of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the social anxiety by</font>

19
00:00:45,570 --> 00:00:50,640
actually going out<font color="#CCCCCC"> and trying to talk to</font>

20
00:00:47,399 --> 00:00:52,679
<font color="#E5E5E5">people but what he's experiencing what</font>

21
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:54,480
he believes is happening is that people

22
00:00:52,679 --> 00:00:57,000
are nice<font color="#CCCCCC"> to him you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> know they'll smile</font>

23
00:00:54,479 --> 00:00:58,828
and say yes very<font color="#CCCCCC"> good but never really</font>

24
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:00,359
want to go out with<font color="#E5E5E5"> him never really</font>

25
00:00:58,829 --> 00:01:04,260
want to do anything<font color="#E5E5E5"> with</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> him and he's</font>

26
00:01:00,359 --> 00:01:07,439
feeling<font color="#E5E5E5"> lonely you know now he's faced</font>

27
00:01:04,260 --> 00:01:10,430
with this situation where he wants<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

28
00:01:07,438 --> 00:01:12,449
know<font color="#CCCCCC"> whether he should just deny himself</font>

29
00:01:10,430 --> 00:01:15,118
relationships with other people women

30
00:01:12,450 --> 00:01:19,109
and immerse himself fully into his

31
00:01:15,118 --> 00:01:23,430
mastery with just hopes of perhaps being

32
00:01:19,109 --> 00:01:25,349
able to to receive in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> future or does</font>

33
00:01:23,430 --> 00:01:27,118
he try to juggle this thing where you

34
00:01:25,349 --> 00:01:29,640
<font color="#CCCCCC">know do I keep trying do I keep trying</font>

35
00:01:27,118 --> 00:01:32,640
to develop relationships with people

36
00:01:29,640 --> 00:01:35,099
because it's not<font color="#E5E5E5"> working</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> me and</font>

37
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:37,219
<font color="#CCCCCC">apparently it's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> not working I had to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> sit</font>

with<font color="#E5E5E5"> this one for a little while but</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

39
00:01:37,219 --> 00:01:42,359
want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to share something</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> with you when I</font>

40
00:01:39,239 --> 00:01:44,519
first went into business and when I say

41
00:01:42,359 --> 00:01:45,929
that it's because I do this because it

42
00:01:44,519 --> 00:01:49,649
wasn't necessarily a business I was a

43
00:01:45,930 --> 00:01:51,960
personal<font color="#E5E5E5"> trainer in a in a big box gym</font>

44
00:01:49,649 --> 00:01:52,950
you know commercial<font color="#CCCCCC"> gym and you had to</font>

45
00:01:51,959 --> 00:01:54,359
sell yourself you had to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be a</font>

46
00:01:52,950 --> 00:01:56,728
salesperson<font color="#E5E5E5"> you had to sell your</font>

47
00:01:54,359 --> 00:01:59,759
services and this was the very first

48
00:01:56,728 --> 00:02:04,019
time in my life that I had to learn a

49
00:01:59,759 --> 00:02:06,118
new skill and actually actively engage

50
00:02:04,019 --> 00:02:08,038
with people in<font color="#E5E5E5"> order to ask them for</font>

51
00:02:06,118 --> 00:02:09,800
money right it's a very difficult thing

52
00:02:08,038 --> 00:02:11,269
to do especially you know what I

53
00:02:09,800 --> 00:02:12,860
when everything's basically handed to

54
00:02:11,270 --> 00:02:14,060
you most people have jobs where you're

55
00:02:12,860 --> 00:02:15,770
just<font color="#E5E5E5"> get a paycheck I had to step</font>

56
00:02:14,060 --> 00:02:18,710
<font color="#E5E5E5">outside myself and develop the skills</font>

57
00:02:15,770 --> 00:02:20,600
associated with offering my services and

58
00:02:18,710 --> 00:02:22,040
asking people<font color="#CCCCCC"> for money and and it was</font>

59
00:02:20,599 --> 00:02:24,680
<font color="#E5E5E5">very uncomfortable but what I did</font>

60
00:02:22,039 --> 00:02:27,049
instinctively but I now look back and

61
00:02:24,680 --> 00:02:30,439
consider your problem with it with

62
00:02:27,050 --> 00:02:33,500
regard to it is<font color="#CCCCCC"> I motivated the other</font>

63
00:02:30,439 --> 00:02:35,419
personal trainers to do better in their

64
00:02:33,500 --> 00:02:37,430
sales you see I didn't know shit about

65
00:02:35,419 --> 00:02:40,219
sales but when the<font color="#E5E5E5"> other trainers were</font>

66
00:02:37,430 --> 00:02:43,730
down and kind of Amanda<font color="#E5E5E5"> sucks nobody</font>

67
00:02:40,219 --> 00:02:46,819
wants to hire<font color="#E5E5E5"> me I always motivated them</font>

68
00:02:43,729 --> 00:02:50,539
to do better so that<font color="#E5E5E5"> they could get more</font>

69
00:02:46,819 --> 00:02:53,629
sales for themselves and in<font color="#E5E5E5"> turn what</font>

70
00:02:50,539 --> 00:02:56,569
really ended up happening<font color="#E5E5E5"> was all of my</font>

71
00:02:53,629 --> 00:02:58,639
words of encouragement to them really

72
00:02:56,569 --> 00:03:01,909
brainwashed myself they say one of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

73
00:02:58,639 --> 00:03:03,979
<font color="#E5E5E5">best ways</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to learn is to teach and I</font>

74
00:03:01,909 --> 00:03:06,199
taught themselves even though I was no

75
00:03:03,979 --> 00:03:08,750
<font color="#E5E5E5">salesmen myself but I tell you what over</font>

76
00:03:06,199 --> 00:03:10,759
time I sales skills improved to the

77
00:03:08,750 --> 00:03:14,209
point where I<font color="#E5E5E5"> was the top salesman in a</font>

78
00:03:10,759 --> 00:03:16,310
at that gym the reason why I immolate

79
00:03:14,209 --> 00:03:18,530
the story to you is because there is a

80
00:03:16,310 --> 00:03:20,000
skill that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you would like to develop</font>

81
00:03:18,530 --> 00:03:22,789
there's somewhere that<font color="#CCCCCC"> you'd like to</font>

82
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:26,150
<font color="#E5E5E5">grow stronger and my invitation</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to you</font>

83
00:03:22,789 --> 00:03:31,219
is to find someone<font color="#E5E5E5"> who</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is in relation to</font>

84
00:03:26,150 --> 00:03:33,590
you weaker right socially weaker and

85
00:03:31,219 --> 00:03:35,120
those who are typically socially weaker

86
00:03:33,590 --> 00:03:38,509
when I say socially I just mean that the

87
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:40,189
amount of influence that<font color="#E5E5E5"> they have in</font>

88
00:03:38,509 --> 00:03:44,689
their environment<font color="#E5E5E5"> and in the world</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> are</font>

89
00:03:40,189 --> 00:03:49,250
children ok so my invitation to<font color="#E5E5E5"> you is</font>

90
00:03:44,689 --> 00:03:52,129
<font color="#CCCCCC">to look for a big brother opportunity</font>

91
00:03:49,250 --> 00:03:54,050
look for a<font color="#CCCCCC"> situation or</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> organization</font>

92
00:03:52,129 --> 00:03:56,900
where I don't know what country<font color="#CCCCCC"> live in</font>

93
00:03:54,050 --> 00:03:59,750
where there are younger boys who don't

94
00:03:56,900 --> 00:04:01,430
have father figures or just you know

95
00:03:59,750 --> 00:04:03,550
that either<font color="#CCCCCC"> there they're orphans or</font>

96
00:04:01,430 --> 00:04:05,810
what the case may be and they've

97
00:04:03,550 --> 00:04:08,120
enrolled in<font color="#E5E5E5"> this big brother-type</font>

98
00:04:05,810 --> 00:04:10,640
program they exist all over the world

99
00:04:08,120 --> 00:04:13,250
i'm pretty sure and then you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know older</font>

100
00:04:10,639 --> 00:04:14,689
men go you know you're 21 years old you

101
00:04:13,250 --> 00:04:17,029
go there and there's a nine-year-old boy

102
00:04:14,689 --> 00:04:19,129
<font color="#CCCCCC">who's like you know life sucks my dad</font>

103
00:04:17,029 --> 00:04:20,689
left us when we were<font color="#E5E5E5"> a kid I don't</font>

104
00:04:19,129 --> 00:04:22,829
<font color="#E5E5E5">nobody wants to throw a baseball with me</font>

105
00:04:20,689 --> 00:04:24,259
and you go when you support<font color="#CCCCCC"> that kid</font>

106
00:04:22,829 --> 00:04:26,758
coming the strongest version of himself

107
00:04:24,259 --> 00:04:29,580
throw the ball with him tell him why

108
00:04:26,759 --> 00:04:33,810
he's awesome why he's cool why that girl

109
00:04:29,579 --> 00:04:35,098
in his class<font color="#CCCCCC"> will hang out with him you</font>

110
00:04:33,810 --> 00:04:36,899
<font color="#E5E5E5">know I don't know what nine year old</font>

111
00:04:35,098 --> 00:04:39,569
boys and girls do but you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> maybe</font>

112
00:04:36,899 --> 00:04:41,429
write love letters or trade stickers or

113
00:04:39,569 --> 00:04:43,139
whatever the<font color="#CCCCCC"> case may be but</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> anyway the</font>

114
00:04:41,430 --> 00:04:45,269
point is that<font color="#E5E5E5"> he's going to have</font>

115
00:04:43,139 --> 00:04:47,879
problems of his own you're<font color="#CCCCCC"> 10 years</font>

116
00:04:45,269 --> 00:04:50,668
older than him 11 12 years older than

117
00:04:47,879 --> 00:04:53,099
him you have a perspective<font color="#E5E5E5"> basically</font>

118
00:04:50,668 --> 00:04:55,639
what we're doing those were igniting the

119
00:04:53,098 --> 00:04:59,819
law of<font color="#E5E5E5"> relativity basically you know</font>

120
00:04:55,639 --> 00:05:02,908
contrast<font color="#CCCCCC"> where compared to his situation</font>

121
00:04:59,819 --> 00:05:04,319
you're like<font color="#E5E5E5"> Superman dude you're ten</font>

122
00:05:02,908 --> 00:05:06,959
times better than him he's nine years

123
00:05:04,319 --> 00:05:09,990
old and<font color="#E5E5E5"> he's got no no father figure or</font>

124
00:05:06,959 --> 00:05:13,019
no whatever lack there is in his life

125
00:05:09,990 --> 00:05:16,620
he's looking to you to fulfill to<font color="#CCCCCC"> fill</font>

126
00:05:13,019 --> 00:05:18,959
for him and in doing so in developing

127
00:05:16,620 --> 00:05:20,959
<font color="#E5E5E5">and supporting and inspiring others to</font>

128
00:05:18,959 --> 00:05:24,778
become stronger versions of themselves

129
00:05:20,959 --> 00:05:28,348
like I<font color="#CCCCCC"> said the best way to learn is to</font>

130
00:05:24,778 --> 00:05:32,759
teach support him and you will grow

131
00:05:28,348 --> 00:05:34,408
stronger this is a this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is not a direct</font>

132
00:05:32,759 --> 00:05:36,330
approach this is a totally indirect

133
00:05:34,408 --> 00:05:39,569
approach this is not going to help<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

134
00:05:36,329 --> 00:05:41,459
with different<font color="#E5E5E5"> skills and tips for being</font>

135
00:05:39,569 --> 00:05:43,770
<font color="#CCCCCC">able to get over your social anxiety but</font>

136
00:05:41,459 --> 00:05:45,418
it's going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to make you a different</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> type</font>

137
00:05:43,769 --> 00:05:47,218
of person you're gonna be the type of

138
00:05:45,418 --> 00:05:49,348
person that lists people up<font color="#E5E5E5"> and in doing</font>

139
00:05:47,218 --> 00:05:52,158
so you will lift yourself up and you

140
00:05:49,348 --> 00:05:54,598
<font color="#E5E5E5">will feel</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> better about yourself that</font>

141
00:05:52,158 --> 00:05:57,269
<font color="#CCCCCC">will ultimately translate into you being</font>
