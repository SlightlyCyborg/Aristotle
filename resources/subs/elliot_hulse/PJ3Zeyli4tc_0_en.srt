1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,959
hey whats up guys so yesterday I decided

2
00:00:01,860 --> 00:00:06,870
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> open up and share a personal</font>

3
00:00:03,959 --> 00:00:09,269
experience a story with you about<font color="#CCCCCC"> how I</font>

4
00:00:06,870 --> 00:00:14,190
was<font color="#CCCCCC"> able to spontaneously manifest a</font>

5
00:00:09,269 --> 00:00:17,219
towel when in great need now the towel

6
00:00:14,189 --> 00:00:19,559
story might seem completely random to

7
00:00:17,219 --> 00:00:22,349
most people right there were several

8
00:00:19,559 --> 00:00:24,929
comments down below that reflected the

9
00:00:22,350 --> 00:00:26,880
idea that perhaps Elliot you're just

10
00:00:24,929 --> 00:00:28,739
being superstitious and there's

11
00:00:26,879 --> 00:00:31,169
absolutely no meaning<font color="#E5E5E5"> to you being</font>

12
00:00:28,739 --> 00:00:34,409
completely lined mind body and desire

13
00:00:31,170 --> 00:00:36,809
with the spontaneous receiving of a gift

14
00:00:34,409 --> 00:00:39,089
at the<font color="#E5E5E5"> right time by the right person in</font>

15
00:00:36,808 --> 00:00:42,030
the right format wait right when I

16
00:00:39,090 --> 00:00:44,070
needed it<font color="#CCCCCC"> right but I want you to</font>

17
00:00:42,030 --> 00:00:46,230
understand<font color="#E5E5E5"> that when I answer your</font>

18
00:00:44,070 --> 00:00:48,149
questions<font color="#E5E5E5"> about your mommy and daddy not</font>

19
00:00:46,229 --> 00:00:51,148
understanding your desire<font color="#CCCCCC"> to do</font>

20
00:00:48,149 --> 00:00:52,710
something besides go to college when I

21
00:00:51,149 --> 00:00:54,539
answer<font color="#E5E5E5"> your questions about your</font>

22
00:00:52,710 --> 00:00:58,009
girlfriend breaking up with you or

23
00:00:54,539 --> 00:01:00,929
cheating with your best friend on you

24
00:00:58,009 --> 00:01:03,238
when I answer those questions and when

25
00:01:00,929 --> 00:01:06,719
you watch those videos and when you feel

26
00:01:03,238 --> 00:01:09,179
relief that perhaps there's hope in your

27
00:01:06,719 --> 00:01:13,379
dire circumstances understand that I'm

28
00:01:09,180 --> 00:01:16,470
doing<font color="#E5E5E5"> the exact same thing I am choosing</font>

29
00:01:13,379 --> 00:01:20,579
to find significance in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> complete</font>

30
00:01:16,469 --> 00:01:24,209
randomness and meaninglessness of your

31
00:01:20,579 --> 00:01:27,269
life that's what<font color="#CCCCCC"> I do i find</font>

32
00:01:24,209 --> 00:01:30,298
significance in order to allow myself to

33
00:01:27,269 --> 00:01:32,459
bud and blossom and move forward towards

34
00:01:30,299 --> 00:01:35,880
everything<font color="#CCCCCC"> i want in life and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> i offer</font>

35
00:01:32,459 --> 00:01:38,399
you the same advice rather than looking

36
00:01:35,879 --> 00:01:41,548
at circumstances and experiences as

37
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:44,640
random maybe they are random maybe there

38
00:01:41,549 --> 00:01:47,579
is absolutely no meaning to anything on

39
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:49,228
earth to anything in your life to you to

40
00:01:47,578 --> 00:01:52,669
<font color="#E5E5E5">the food you eat to the women you have</font>

41
00:01:49,228 --> 00:01:54,929
sex<font color="#E5E5E5"> with to your parents but</font>

42
00:01:52,670 --> 00:01:58,769
significance<font color="#E5E5E5"> is something that a human</font>

43
00:01:54,930 --> 00:02:00,450
being chooses<font color="#CCCCCC"> to place on something else</font>

44
00:01:58,769 --> 00:02:02,789
<font color="#CCCCCC">i love words and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> i love that word</font>

45
00:02:00,450 --> 00:02:05,340
significance because it seems like<font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font>

46
00:02:02,790 --> 00:02:07,710
comes from the<font color="#E5E5E5"> root word sign to put</font>

47
00:02:05,340 --> 00:02:11,370
your authenticity or your authorship

48
00:02:07,709 --> 00:02:13,009
your name on the friggin thing so when<font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font>

49
00:02:11,370 --> 00:02:14,900
put<font color="#E5E5E5"> my name on the experience</font>

50
00:02:13,009 --> 00:02:19,298
of the towel<font color="#CCCCCC"> coming to me when I needed</font>

51
00:02:14,900 --> 00:02:24,950
it it basically means that<font color="#CCCCCC"> it offers a</font>

52
00:02:19,299 --> 00:02:28,340
profound spiritual signifier of how the

53
00:02:24,949 --> 00:02:31,810
universe<font color="#CCCCCC"> works in fact that's how</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> my</font>

54
00:02:28,340 --> 00:02:33,799
life has been up until this point

55
00:02:31,810 --> 00:02:35,360
everything that I have everything that I

56
00:02:33,799 --> 00:02:37,219
experience everything<font color="#E5E5E5"> that I feel is</font>

57
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:40,400
because of the significance that I

58
00:02:37,219 --> 00:02:42,348
<font color="#E5E5E5">personally put on it you can choose</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

59
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:44,209
put significance on absolutely anything

60
00:02:42,348 --> 00:02:47,179
that you want the only question I ask is

61
00:02:44,209 --> 00:02:48,739
how is that working out for you<font color="#E5E5E5"> so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> for</font>

62
00:02:47,180 --> 00:02:51,650
<font color="#CCCCCC">example the Christian cross is</font>

63
00:02:48,739 --> 00:02:54,500
meaningless it's too frigging sticks

64
00:02:51,650 --> 00:02:56,569
that dissect each other some people

65
00:02:54,500 --> 00:02:58,310
think it means salvation that's the

66
00:02:56,568 --> 00:03:00,708
<font color="#CCCCCC">significance they give it and if they</font>

67
00:02:58,310 --> 00:03:02,539
receive the feeling of salvation every

68
00:03:00,709 --> 00:03:04,878
time they pray to the cross then it's

69
00:03:02,539 --> 00:03:07,189
real some people say that<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's</font>

70
00:03:04,878 --> 00:03:08,689
completely random and meaningless well

71
00:03:07,189 --> 00:03:11,509
that's fine you<font color="#CCCCCC"> can completely ignore</font>

72
00:03:08,689 --> 00:03:13,598
the symbol and offer it no significance

73
00:03:11,509 --> 00:03:15,979
by not putting your signature on it<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

74
00:03:13,598 --> 00:03:18,709
happen to<font color="#E5E5E5"> take the ancient approach that</font>

75
00:03:15,979 --> 00:03:21,018
<font color="#E5E5E5">the symbol represents the crossroads or</font>

76
00:03:18,709 --> 00:03:23,239
the axis between the spiritual dimension

77
00:03:21,019 --> 00:03:25,969
<font color="#CCCCCC">and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the physical dimension that just</font>

78
00:03:23,239 --> 00:03:28,128
happens to work for me it's easily<font color="#CCCCCC"> be</font>

79
00:03:25,969 --> 00:03:31,848
<font color="#E5E5E5">easily placed into my philosophy and</font>

80
00:03:28,128 --> 00:03:37,729
experience for life so I use it but it's

81
00:03:31,848 --> 00:03:39,589
completely meaningless so I just wanted

82
00:03:37,729 --> 00:03:41,298
<font color="#CCCCCC">to offer</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to you with regard to how</font>

83
00:03:39,590 --> 00:03:43,009
you choose to think<font color="#E5E5E5"> about things in your</font>

84
00:03:41,299 --> 00:03:46,150
life and how you choose to receive it

00:03:43,009 --> 00:03:48,709
<font color="#E5E5E5">when</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Elliot health's uses it for himself</font>

86
00:03:46,150 --> 00:03:50,209
just one more<font color="#CCCCCC"> thing I wanted</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to share or</font>

87
00:03:48,709 --> 00:03:54,848
get off<font color="#E5E5E5"> my chest before i go</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> into</font>

00:03:50,209 --> 00:03:57,620
today's message the motivational

89
00:03:54,848 --> 00:03:59,628
inspirational enlightening insightful

90
00:03:57,620 --> 00:04:02,090
information that I've shared with you

guys through these videos over<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

course of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the separate last several</font>

93
00:04:03,348 --> 00:04:09,259
years comes out of my desire to support

00:04:06,799 --> 00:04:11,359
you in<font color="#CCCCCC"> becoming a stronger version</font>

95
00:04:09,259 --> 00:04:15,560
yourself with the tools that I

96
00:04:11,359 --> 00:04:18,590
personally use for myself so when you

97
00:04:15,560 --> 00:04:20,560
see Elliott Hulse taking a break<font color="#CCCCCC"> from</font>

98
00:04:18,589 --> 00:04:24,079
<font color="#CCCCCC">YouTube when you see Elliott Hulse</font>

99
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:25,920
wearing significant stones around his

100
00:04:24,079 --> 00:04:28,399
neck when you see<font color="#E5E5E5"> Elliott how</font>

101
00:04:25,920 --> 00:04:31,290
seemingly being superstitious about

102
00:04:28,399 --> 00:04:32,549
random events in his life understand

103
00:04:31,290 --> 00:04:34,350
<font color="#E5E5E5">that you're probably watching this</font>

104
00:04:32,550 --> 00:04:37,710
channel because<font color="#E5E5E5"> I did the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> same thing for</font>

105
00:04:34,350 --> 00:04:39,660
you so if you ever find yourself

106
00:04:37,709 --> 00:04:42,120
uncomfortable with the way Elliot frames

107
00:04:39,660 --> 00:04:44,130
his life<font color="#E5E5E5"> or frames or circumstances or</font>

108
00:04:42,120 --> 00:04:48,180
frames the people and relationship in

past several years there are several

videos that you've made<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> save my</font>

115

life even but now Elliot I'm very

116
00:05:01,589 --> 00:05:05,159
<font color="#CCCCCC">confused and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> upset with you because it</font>

seems that you're doing things<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

118
00:05:05,160 --> 00:05:13,020
don't well that simply just don't jive

119
00:05:09,480 --> 00:05:16,230
with your ignorance that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> really what</font>

120
00:05:13,019 --> 00:05:17,909
it<font color="#CCCCCC"> is it's okay</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to receive a gift but</font>

121
00:05:16,230 --> 00:05:20,430
when the individual uses as a gift to

122
00:05:17,910 --> 00:05:22,439
support himself it doesn't feel so good

123
00:05:20,430 --> 00:05:24,180
does it<font color="#CCCCCC"> and that's what happens to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a lot</font>

of people<font color="#E5E5E5"> watching my video so if</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

built<font color="#E5E5E5"> and what my transparent</font>

moving forward<font color="#E5E5E5"> will look like it will</font>

132
00:05:45,480 --> 00:05:50,129
look<font color="#CCCCCC"> like</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Elliott Hulse on his journey</font>

133
00:05:47,579 --> 00:05:52,560
using his own advice in order to grow

134
00:05:50,129 --> 00:05:56,279
himself stronger because without a

135
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:58,110
strong Elliott Hulse there is no room<font color="#E5E5E5"> or</font>

opportunity for me to fulfill<font color="#E5E5E5"> my</font>

empower others now if you're ready for

<font color="#CCCCCC">some more Elliott Hulse hippie shit</font>

140

listen closely last night there was a

full<font color="#E5E5E5"> moon in the minds of several people</font>
