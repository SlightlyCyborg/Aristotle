1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,220
um what is your definition of truth in

2
00:00:06,120 --> 00:00:13,289
the world what isn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> what is what</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

3
00:00:08,220 --> 00:00:14,880
your definition the truth is<font color="#CCCCCC"> true would</font>

4
00:00:13,289 --> 00:00:16,559
<font color="#E5E5E5">you feel about you</font>

5
00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:23,399
when you feel like truth in the world we

6
00:00:16,559 --> 00:00:25,199
feel that group of the resonate with it

7
00:00:23,399 --> 00:00:28,039
needs to be what needs to be<font color="#CCCCCC"> considered</font>

8
00:00:25,199 --> 00:00:32,668
before we can stab anything as proof as

9
00:00:28,039 --> 00:00:34,979
truth is first the subjectivity of the

10
00:00:32,668 --> 00:00:37,289
individual who is<font color="#E5E5E5"> looking at what is</font>

11
00:00:34,979 --> 00:00:40,019
<font color="#E5E5E5">being determined as true if you look</font>

12
00:00:37,289 --> 00:00:42,329
<font color="#E5E5E5">into the quantum physics out there and</font>

13
00:00:40,020 --> 00:00:45,680
I'm not by any<font color="#CCCCCC"> means an expert but</font>

14
00:00:42,329 --> 00:00:47,969
they're realizing that the observer

15
00:00:45,679 --> 00:00:49,560
changes what is being observed is

16
00:00:47,969 --> 00:00:52,019
<font color="#E5E5E5">anybody familiar with this idea that</font>

17
00:00:49,560 --> 00:00:54,510
right what they do is<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's very</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> strange</font>

18
00:00:52,020 --> 00:00:56,280
as we get smaller and smaller group<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

19
00:00:54,509 --> 00:00:58,109
<font color="#E5E5E5">bits and particles and electronic shit</font>

20
00:00:56,280 --> 00:01:00,630
that they<font color="#E5E5E5"> want to study they realize</font>

21
00:00:58,109 --> 00:01:02,490
<font color="#E5E5E5">that they're here studying of that</font>

22
00:01:00,630 --> 00:01:06,478
particle makes it disappear or it

23
00:01:02,490 --> 00:01:08,879
affects the way that particle behaves so

24
00:01:06,478 --> 00:01:15,900
to say that something is true absence of

25
00:01:08,879 --> 00:01:17,908
that which is observing it is not so you

26
00:01:15,900 --> 00:01:21,329
see and that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> why a lot of time by</font>

27
00:01:17,909 --> 00:01:23,759
invitation is to go in<font color="#CCCCCC"> here</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> because if</font>

28
00:01:21,328 --> 00:01:27,589
we constantly look<font color="#E5E5E5"> out here knowing</font>

29
00:01:23,759 --> 00:01:30,599
through religious and now scientific

30
00:01:27,590 --> 00:01:33,299
assertions that what I'm looking at is

31
00:01:30,599 --> 00:01:37,038
changing based on my looking<font color="#E5E5E5"> at then</font>

32
00:01:33,299 --> 00:01:40,079
<font color="#E5E5E5">stopping</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> me out look in what's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> over here</font>

33
00:01:37,039 --> 00:01:43,739
<font color="#E5E5E5">because clearly what's over</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> here is</font>

34
00:01:40,078 --> 00:01:46,048
affecting what's out there right so if

35
00:01:43,739 --> 00:01:48,239
I'm looking<font color="#E5E5E5"> for truth I'm looking for</font>

36
00:01:46,049 --> 00:01:49,930
and I inviting you<font color="#E5E5E5"> inviting people to</font>

37
00:01:48,239 --> 00:01:54,969
become more

38
00:01:49,930 --> 00:01:57,100
objective be more self be in tune with

39
00:01:54,969 --> 00:02:00,579
the subjective experiences that you have

40
00:01:57,099 --> 00:02:02,978
and study yourself from afar study

41
00:02:00,579 --> 00:02:06,060
yourself as a<font color="#CCCCCC"> moose studying with</font>

42
00:02:02,978 --> 00:02:09,310
someone else called is all true because

43
00:02:06,060 --> 00:02:11,620
if I find that this path works for me

44
00:02:09,310 --> 00:02:13,689
and I walk this path and this has been

45
00:02:11,620 --> 00:02:16,030
<font color="#E5E5E5">my experience and then I tell someone</font>

46
00:02:13,689 --> 00:02:18,310
else hey what were you see those

47
00:02:16,030 --> 00:02:20,770
footsteps get in line because that's the

48
00:02:18,310 --> 00:02:23,140
right path not realizing<font color="#E5E5E5"> that that</font>

49
00:02:20,770 --> 00:02:25,780
person is affecting each one of those

50
00:02:23,139 --> 00:02:28,559
what steps that I just traveled and I'm

51
00:02:25,780 --> 00:02:31,060
telling him to travel expect him and

52
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:33,819
giving him hope to expect to get the

53
00:02:31,060 --> 00:02:36,400
same<font color="#CCCCCC"> result that I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> just got then I'm</font>

54
00:02:33,819 --> 00:02:42,069
being a fool so my answer is the truth

55
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:44,349
<font color="#E5E5E5">really is here what are you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> looking for</font>

56
00:02:42,069 --> 00:02:48,039
who are you really that's for the truth

57
00:02:44,349 --> 00:02:52,719
<font color="#E5E5E5">who are you I can I can</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> rant on further</font>

58
00:02:48,039 --> 00:02:55,329
<font color="#E5E5E5">whatever I agree who are you you know</font>

59
00:02:52,719 --> 00:02:58,870
<font color="#E5E5E5">regardless if you're a scientist or</font>

60
00:02:55,330 --> 00:03:02,230
increased you will there's assertions to

61
00:02:58,870 --> 00:03:05,019
the fact that God is found two sets the

62
00:03:02,229 --> 00:03:07,659
kingdom<font color="#CCCCCC"> is found with it right and then</font>

63
00:03:05,019 --> 00:03:09,730
what I<font color="#E5E5E5"> just described collecting what</font>

64
00:03:07,659 --> 00:03:12,989
the villains pretty fucking this stuff

65
00:03:09,729 --> 00:03:12,988
off it's us
