00:00:00,040 --> 00:00:12,339
yo Elliot what's up guys today's

2
00:00:10,689 --> 00:00:15,039
question comes from strengthcamp online

3
00:00:12,339 --> 00:00:18,579
member<font color="#CCCCCC"> David Evan</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Flores he goes on ask</font>

4
00:00:15,039 --> 00:00:22,809
how do I go from being a gymnast so

5
00:00:18,579 --> 00:00:25,809
essentially<font color="#CCCCCC"> he says he's a 56 125 pound</font>

6
00:00:22,809 --> 00:00:27,759
former gymnast who wants to develop his

7
00:00:25,809 --> 00:00:29,439
ability to do the Iron Cross and those

8
00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:31,179
you who know anything about gymnastics

9
00:00:29,440 --> 00:00:33,160
the iron crosses where they<font color="#E5E5E5"> take the two</font>

10
00:00:31,179 --> 00:00:34,960
rings and grab them they can hold their

11
00:00:33,159 --> 00:00:37,119
bodies out like this right so imagine

12
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:39,160
<font color="#CCCCCC">how difficult that must be to hold</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> your</font>

13
00:00:37,119 --> 00:00:40,719
hold your entire body weight out<font color="#E5E5E5"> with</font>

14
00:00:39,159 --> 00:00:43,899
your arms extended this way with the

15
00:00:40,719 --> 00:00:47,019
<font color="#E5E5E5">Rings quite an athletic feat you want to</font>

16
00:00:43,899 --> 00:00:49,839
be<font color="#CCCCCC"> able to either maintain or retain the</font>

17
00:00:47,020 --> 00:00:51,970
ability to do this but at the same time

18
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:53,620
he also plays basketball and he wants<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

19
00:00:51,969 --> 00:00:57,579
be<font color="#CCCCCC"> able to dunk a basketball so he's</font>

20
00:00:53,619 --> 00:00:59,859
asking can I have contradictory goals if

21
00:00:57,579 --> 00:01:02,350
I want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be able to maintain or develop</font>

22
00:00:59,859 --> 00:01:04,239
my Iron Cross I really<font color="#E5E5E5"> can't have big</font>

23
00:01:02,350 --> 00:01:06,219
heavy bulky legs that would be

24
00:01:04,239 --> 00:01:08,920
associated with somebody that can jump

25
00:01:06,219 --> 00:01:10,420
<font color="#E5E5E5">and dunk a basketball and again those of</font>

26
00:01:08,920 --> 00:01:12,670
you if you've ever watched<font color="#E5E5E5"> in nastics</font>

27
00:01:10,420 --> 00:01:14,500
these guys they got huge upper bodies

28
00:01:12,670 --> 00:01:17,140
and then and then it<font color="#E5E5E5"> just looks</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> like</font>

29
00:01:14,500 --> 00:01:20,260
this they<font color="#E5E5E5"> just come down to a pin right</font>

30
00:01:17,140 --> 00:01:21,939
they look like a triangle<font color="#E5E5E5"> and it's</font>

31
00:01:20,260 --> 00:01:24,159
partly because you don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> want to have</font>

32
00:01:21,939 --> 00:01:25,359
big legs when you're on that Iron Horse

33
00:01:24,159 --> 00:01:27,219
and you're whipping your legs around

34
00:01:25,359 --> 00:01:30,219
when you're trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do iron crosses</font>

35
00:01:27,219 --> 00:01:32,289
and whatnot so<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's it's it's really not</font>

36
00:01:30,219 --> 00:01:34,689
<font color="#E5E5E5">sports specific it's not advantageous to</font>

37
00:01:32,290 --> 00:01:38,340
the sport<font color="#CCCCCC"> to have quads and glutes and</font>

38
00:01:34,689 --> 00:01:41,319
big giant hamstrings and calves right so

39
00:01:38,340 --> 00:01:43,570
<font color="#CCCCCC">our buddy wants to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> know how can I go</font>

40
00:01:41,319 --> 00:01:48,399
about developing my jumping skills and

41
00:01:43,569 --> 00:01:52,269
maintaining my gymnastic prowess well it

42
00:01:48,400 --> 00:01:55,450
reminds<font color="#E5E5E5"> me</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of a seminar I once went to</font>

43
00:01:52,269 --> 00:01:57,459
<font color="#E5E5E5">or I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> watched their own VHS was while</font>

44
00:01:55,450 --> 00:02:00,368
<font color="#E5E5E5">back early in my career that was</font>

45
00:01:57,459 --> 00:02:03,219
presented<font color="#E5E5E5"> by coach Kim Gauss right and</font>

46
00:02:00,368 --> 00:02:04,590
he tells this story about<font color="#E5E5E5"> how he was</font>

47
00:02:03,219 --> 00:02:07,810
training a

48
00:02:04,590 --> 00:02:09,490
an ice skater a figure skater right and

49
00:02:07,810 --> 00:02:13,030
<font color="#E5E5E5">you can imagine it was a woman there</font>

50
00:02:09,490 --> 00:02:14,920
<font color="#CCCCCC">there long slender but they're powerful</font>

51
00:02:13,030 --> 00:02:18,280
right i mean these chicks they got nice

52
00:02:14,919 --> 00:02:21,579
lean legs nice slim bodies and then they

53
00:02:18,280 --> 00:02:24,400
jump up in the air and<font color="#E5E5E5"> do this boom then</font>

54
00:02:21,580 --> 00:02:26,230
keep<font color="#E5E5E5"> going right just imagine so uh</font>

55
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:28,240
you've got to have some pretty powerful

56
00:02:26,229 --> 00:02:32,619
freaking legs to be able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to jump up in</font>

57
00:02:28,240 --> 00:02:34,000
the air come down do all the the liaison

58
00:02:32,620 --> 00:02:35,709
whatever the hell they do all that crazy

59
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:37,239
stuff I don't know if they actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> jump</font>

60
00:02:35,709 --> 00:02:39,009
up in the air<font color="#E5E5E5"> and do that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> right I think</font>

61
00:02:37,239 --> 00:02:44,469
they just<font color="#E5E5E5"> spin but either way they need</font>

62
00:02:39,009 --> 00:02:46,419
really incredibly powerful legs so uh he

63
00:02:44,469 --> 00:02:48,129
he go he takes her into the strength

64
00:02:46,419 --> 00:02:49,689
<font color="#E5E5E5">conditioning room I guess it's</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> really at</font>

65
00:02:48,129 --> 00:02:52,359
a university takes her into the southern

66
00:02:49,689 --> 00:02:53,800
conditioning room amongst the football

67
00:02:52,360 --> 00:02:55,750
players and that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> imagine</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

68
00:02:53,800 --> 00:02:58,269
course football players are huge there

69
00:02:55,750 --> 00:03:01,569
<font color="#CCCCCC">Jack they're squatting they're dead</font>

70
00:02:58,269 --> 00:03:04,180
lifting their massive<font color="#CCCCCC"> their beasts and</font>

71
00:03:01,569 --> 00:03:08,650
here comes this petite little chick who

72
00:03:04,180 --> 00:03:13,330
plays on ice and he loads up the barb

73
00:03:08,650 --> 00:03:15,219
the barbell in the rack one plate two

74
00:03:13,330 --> 00:03:20,829
plates when I say two plates I mean to

75
00:03:15,219 --> 00:03:22,659
25 three plates 315 four plates by the

76
00:03:20,829 --> 00:03:24,099
time he gets to the fourth plate all the

77
00:03:22,659 --> 00:03:25,689
football players like what the<font color="#CCCCCC"> fuck is</font>

78
00:03:24,099 --> 00:03:27,639
this guy doing and here's this pretty

79
00:03:25,689 --> 00:03:31,750
girl that he's he's supposedly gonna

80
00:03:27,639 --> 00:03:34,238
coach and she<font color="#E5E5E5"> gets underneath the bar</font>

81
00:03:31,750 --> 00:03:38,400
right and then he sets up a box in front

82
00:03:34,239 --> 00:03:41,379
of her and she proceeds to do a step up

83
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:44,939
she does a single leg step up with like

84
00:03:41,379 --> 00:03:48,030
405 on the ball in the bar

85
00:03:44,939 --> 00:03:50,219
now she<font color="#E5E5E5"> doesn't do it for refs she does</font>

86
00:03:48,030 --> 00:03:52,409
singles and the point that he was trying

87
00:03:50,219 --> 00:03:54,719
<font color="#CCCCCC">to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> make in this seminar was that it</font>

88
00:03:52,409 --> 00:03:56,939
doesn't<font color="#CCCCCC"> require a lot of muscular bulk</font>

89
00:03:54,719 --> 00:04:00,960
in order to grow strength and power in

90
00:03:56,939 --> 00:04:02,699
the legs this thin young lady who is

91
00:04:00,960 --> 00:04:04,560
performing a sport that requires a

92
00:04:02,699 --> 00:04:06,569
tremendous amount<font color="#E5E5E5"> of power wasn't</font>

93
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:07,770
getting any bulkier and she wasn't

94
00:04:06,569 --> 00:04:10,319
<font color="#E5E5E5">getting bulky like the football players</font>

95
00:04:07,770 --> 00:04:12,600
because she was simply training the

96
00:04:10,319 --> 00:04:17,129
nervous system to respond in such a way

97
00:04:12,599 --> 00:04:19,108
that it could overcome overcome the

98
00:04:17,129 --> 00:04:20,459
resistance of the weight when you jump

99
00:04:19,108 --> 00:04:22,739
it's kind of the same<font color="#CCCCCC"> thing you know</font>

100
00:04:20,459 --> 00:04:25,170
<font color="#E5E5E5">jumping is overcoming the resistance of</font>

101
00:04:22,740 --> 00:04:30,750
your body weight against the floor and

102
00:04:25,170 --> 00:04:32,430
in a very powerful or<font color="#E5E5E5"> time intensive way</font>

103
00:04:30,750 --> 00:04:36,110
so the difference<font color="#CCCCCC"> between like strength</font>

104
00:04:32,430 --> 00:04:39,030
and powers that time is one of the

105
00:04:36,110 --> 00:04:40,860
parameters within the equation has to be

106
00:04:39,029 --> 00:04:43,139
done quickly right but you need to be

107
00:04:40,860 --> 00:04:45,420
<font color="#E5E5E5">really strong in order to perform the</font>

108
00:04:43,139 --> 00:04:48,269
movement quickly so anyway my point here

109
00:04:45,420 --> 00:04:50,910
is<font color="#E5E5E5"> my friend there is no need to gain</font>

110
00:04:48,269 --> 00:04:53,189
massive amounts of bulk in your legs in

111
00:04:50,910 --> 00:04:55,700
<font color="#CCCCCC">order to jump really high</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> in fact you</font>

112
00:04:53,189 --> 00:04:58,680
can get really really strong using low

113
00:04:55,699 --> 00:05:01,649
repetitions with high weights followed

114
00:04:58,680 --> 00:05:03,900
by jumping I mean that's you get get

115
00:05:01,649 --> 00:05:05,909
better jump<font color="#E5E5E5"> in by jumping right so there</font>

116
00:05:03,899 --> 00:05:08,459
<font color="#E5E5E5">you have it man so there it is you can</font>

117
00:05:05,910 --> 00:05:11,189
<font color="#E5E5E5">gain both things you can have your cake</font>

118
00:05:08,459 --> 00:05:15,389
and eat it too you can be an iron

119
00:05:11,189 --> 00:05:17,810
crosser and a dunker done<font color="#CCCCCC"> Elliott's it</font>

120
00:05:15,389 --> 00:05:17,810
what

121
00:05:18,829 --> 00:05:20,889
you
