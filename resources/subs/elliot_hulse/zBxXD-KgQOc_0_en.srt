22
00:01:06,769 --> 00:01:10,530
if I<font color="#CCCCCC"> stay live in the system i'm</font>

23
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:13,200
basically feeding his system that<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

30
00:01:23,368 --> 00:01:27,688
grateful for the system however I can't

31
00:01:25,829 --> 00:01:29,969
stop feeling that<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm beating</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font>

32
00:01:27,688 --> 00:01:32,699
system by paying taxes Social Security

33
00:01:29,969 --> 00:01:35,188
debts and I see the system<font color="#E5E5E5"> as an unjust</font>

34
00:01:32,700 --> 00:01:36,960
one many people<font color="#E5E5E5"> are struggling and</font>

35
00:01:35,188 --> 00:01:39,149
obviously I would love<font color="#CCCCCC"> to change this if</font>

36
00:01:36,959 --> 00:01:42,509
I could any advice what do you<font color="#E5E5E5"> think</font>

37
00:01:39,150 --> 00:01:44,520
<font color="#CCCCCC">about living off the grid creating an</font>

38
00:01:42,509 --> 00:01:47,099
independent self-sustaining community or

39
00:01:44,519 --> 00:01:51,530
starting a big revolution so on and so

40
00:01:47,099 --> 00:01:54,030
forth so Dan you and I are kind of

41
00:01:51,530 --> 00:01:57,540
swimming in the same river there buddy

42
00:01:54,030 --> 00:02:00,810
<font color="#E5E5E5">because we both have animosity towards</font>

43
00:01:57,540 --> 00:02:04,049
something that has blessed us well the

44
00:02:00,810 --> 00:02:06,899
system is not perfect at all but it is a

45
00:02:04,049 --> 00:02:09,989
system and it's a system by which you

46
00:02:06,899 --> 00:02:11,489
and I have both seen increase in life we

47
00:02:09,989 --> 00:02:12,840
were able to<font color="#E5E5E5"> take advantage of the</font>

48
00:02:11,489 --> 00:02:14,849
technology<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's available</font>

49
00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:16,439
during this particular<font color="#E5E5E5"> day and age we've</font>

50
00:02:14,848 --> 00:02:18,959
<font color="#E5E5E5">been able to take advantage of the</font>

51
00:02:16,439 --> 00:02:22,979
economic machinery that allows<font color="#CCCCCC"> us to</font>

52
00:02:18,959 --> 00:02:24,989
receive monetary or currency<font color="#E5E5E5"> I love that</font>

53
00:02:22,979 --> 00:02:26,818
word currency because it means the

54
00:02:24,989 --> 00:02:28,950
movement<font color="#E5E5E5"> of stuff right when something</font>

is in a<font color="#E5E5E5"> current it's moving electricity</font>

56
00:02:28,949 --> 00:02:32,878
is in a<font color="#E5E5E5"> current that means it's moving</font>

57
00:02:30,209 --> 00:02:34,650
if there is<font color="#CCCCCC"> a current in the ocean that</font>

58
00:02:32,878 --> 00:02:37,348
means it's moving currency is like the

59
00:02:34,650 --> 00:02:39,689
movement<font color="#E5E5E5"> of life force</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> all right so we</font>

call<font color="#CCCCCC"> it money you can call it dollars</font>

61
00:02:39,689 --> 00:02:44,250
euros whatever the whatever the title

62
00:02:42,090 --> 00:02:47,250
it's given its currency it's an energy

63
00:02:44,250 --> 00:02:50,818
currency is not really a thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's a</font>

64
00:02:47,250 --> 00:02:53,129
movement but anyway point is you and I

65
00:02:50,818 --> 00:02:55,818
are able to dive into the river of<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font>

66
00:02:53,129 --> 00:02:59,818
currency where we can be swept away and

67
00:02:55,818 --> 00:03:01,859
offered we can offer our good things and

68
00:02:59,818 --> 00:03:07,889
have good things come back to us but

69
00:03:01,860 --> 00:03:11,190
underneath the currency there is a there

70
00:03:07,889 --> 00:03:16,109
there's muck muck at the bottom<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the</font>

71
00:03:11,189 --> 00:03:19,469
<font color="#CCCCCC">river and like with everything in life</font>

72
00:03:16,110 --> 00:03:21,329
in general<font color="#E5E5E5"> if nothing</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is all a hundred</font>

73
00:03:19,469 --> 00:03:23,609
percent good nothing is all one hundred

74
00:03:21,329 --> 00:03:25,859
percent gap bad nothing is<font color="#CCCCCC"> ever a</font>

75
00:03:23,609 --> 00:03:28,560
hundred percent or whole in any way

76
00:03:25,859 --> 00:03:31,170
<font color="#CCCCCC">shape or form everything is in flux</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

77
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:34,049
balancing itself out both daytime

78
00:03:31,169 --> 00:03:38,219
nighttime up down sista diastole inhale

<font color="#E5E5E5">exhale male female wherever you look God</font>

80
00:03:38,219 --> 00:03:43,348
and nature is doing this thing right

81
00:03:41,969 --> 00:03:45,359
you're watching me through this camera

82
00:03:43,348 --> 00:03:48,500
which is a series of on and off switches

83
00:03:45,359 --> 00:03:51,599
right 10 10 10 right all the digital

84
00:03:48,500 --> 00:03:53,098
stuff that we participated so that's the

85
00:03:51,598 --> 00:03:55,709
first<font color="#E5E5E5"> thing I'd</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> like</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to offer you is to</font>

86
00:03:53,098 --> 00:03:58,979
recognize<font color="#CCCCCC"> that there never is and there</font>

87
00:03:55,709 --> 00:04:01,769
never will be a good without<font color="#CCCCCC"> a bad it's</font>

88
00:03:58,979 --> 00:04:03,719
our attachment to what we think really

89
00:04:01,769 --> 00:04:06,150
the egos attachment right because the

90
00:04:03,719 --> 00:04:07,859
ego is a conglomerate of stories we've

91
00:04:06,150 --> 00:04:09,689
been<font color="#E5E5E5"> told in stories that we tell</font>

92
00:04:07,859 --> 00:04:13,530
ourselves about what is good<font color="#CCCCCC"> and what is</font>

93
00:04:09,689 --> 00:04:15,509
bad right and it's really<font color="#CCCCCC"> the egos</font>

94
00:04:13,530 --> 00:04:17,728
attachment to what we think is

95
00:04:15,509 --> 00:04:20,788
preferable at the particular moment when

96
00:04:17,728 --> 00:04:22,750
I say moment I mean in time right

97
00:04:20,788 --> 00:04:25,810
<font color="#E5E5E5">because we've been doing this for a long</font>

98
00:04:22,750 --> 00:04:27,730
long time<font color="#CCCCCC"> right this story with regard</font>

99
00:04:25,810 --> 00:04:33,879
to civilization is as old as Cain and

100
00:04:27,730 --> 00:04:35,439
Abel right so that's a principle that's

101
00:04:33,879 --> 00:04:37,540
<font color="#E5E5E5">something that is just you you got to</font>

102

snacking on berries and nuts

105
00:04:45,750 --> 00:04:50,050
civilization you're going to have

106
00:04:47,649 --> 00:04:52,810
<font color="#CCCCCC">fucking problems to the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> problems might</font>

107
00:04:50,050 --> 00:04:55,720
<font color="#CCCCCC">be worse because it didn't take several</font>

108
00:04:52,810 --> 00:04:57,160
generations to kind of define to it and

109
00:04:55,720 --> 00:04:58,840
figure out<font color="#E5E5E5"> how we could manipulate the</font>

110
00:04:57,160 --> 00:05:01,180
thing to get us all to one particular

111
00:04:58,839 --> 00:05:03,909
place which<font color="#CCCCCC"> is what this new world order</font>

112
00:05:01,180 --> 00:05:05,259
is like we talked<font color="#CCCCCC"> about that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> one percent</font>

113
00:05:03,910 --> 00:05:08,710
of people and those who make the money

114
00:05:05,259 --> 00:05:13,029
those who own the money as if there are

115
00:05:08,709 --> 00:05:15,399
other evil but then too there's also the

116
00:05:13,029 --> 00:05:17,769
<font color="#E5E5E5">good side of course you know there</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> are</font>

117
00:05:15,399 --> 00:05:21,609
those<font color="#E5E5E5"> who suffer under</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the weight of</font>

118
00:05:17,769 --> 00:05:23,949
this system but hey your kids are fed

119
00:05:21,610 --> 00:05:26,439
right how do<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> like that you got the</font>

120
00:05:23,949 --> 00:05:29,589

00:05:26,439 --> 00:05:32,319
got<font color="#E5E5E5"> wrong clothes to wear when it's cold</font>

122
00:05:29,589 --> 00:05:34,209
you turn on<font color="#CCCCCC"> the heat when it's hot you</font>

123

125
00:05:36,668 --> 00:05:43,629
kinds of shit that's really comfortable

126
00:05:38,379 --> 00:05:47,399
cozy lovely magical even because you got

127
00:05:43,629 --> 00:05:50,860
some evil guys at the top spilling

128
00:05:47,399 --> 00:05:52,899
currency into a system that grows heavy

129
00:05:50,860 --> 00:05:57,449
on the backs of some people<font color="#CCCCCC"> and destroys</font>

130
00:05:52,899 --> 00:05:57,449
the earth right so really

131
00:06:00,259 --> 00:06:03,959
really it's a matter of taking a step

132
00:06:02,339 --> 00:06:05,369
back and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I often think this way the</font>

133
00:06:03,959 --> 00:06:08,339
matter<font color="#E5E5E5"> is taking a step back from our</font>

134
00:06:05,370 --> 00:06:11,370
particular place in<font color="#E5E5E5"> time and looking at</font>

135
00:06:08,339 --> 00:06:14,899
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> evolution of mankind as a whole from</font>

136
00:06:11,370 --> 00:06:17,519
the larger<font color="#CCCCCC"> god perspective if you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> will</font>

137
00:06:14,899 --> 00:06:19,349
meaning<font color="#CCCCCC"> that just because things look a</font>

138
00:06:17,519 --> 00:06:24,449
particular way right now doesn't mean

139
00:06:19,350 --> 00:06:27,000
that this is the this is the end really

140
00:06:24,449 --> 00:06:29,519
there is no end its cycles right there

141
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:34,529
was a time when<font color="#E5E5E5"> Africa was the land of</font>

142
00:06:29,519 --> 00:06:38,579
Kings gold now Africa is the land of war

143
00:06:34,529 --> 00:06:41,069
<font color="#E5E5E5">and terrorism right there's a time when</font>

144
00:06:38,579 --> 00:06:47,389
you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> various aspects of the of this</font>

145
00:06:41,069 --> 00:06:50,579
planet were good sometimes we're bad

146
00:06:47,389 --> 00:06:52,259
sometimes<font color="#E5E5E5"> bad places are good and some</font>

147
00:06:50,579 --> 00:06:57,829
play at times good good places are bad

148
00:06:52,259 --> 00:07:03,480
<font color="#E5E5E5">you know we had matriarchy now we have</font>

149
00:06:57,829 --> 00:07:07,500
patriarchy you had the barter system and

150
00:07:03,480 --> 00:07:09,420
now you have currency with the barter

151
00:07:07,500 --> 00:07:14,790
system you have all types of negatives

152
00:07:09,420 --> 00:07:16,800
also right because<font color="#E5E5E5"> if you want if you</font>

153
00:07:14,790 --> 00:07:18,780
want a new car and all you<font color="#E5E5E5"> got</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is cattle</font>

154
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:20,460
and the guy<font color="#CCCCCC"> that owns the cap car don't</font>

155
00:07:18,779 --> 00:07:22,049
want no cattle you you're fucked you got

156
00:07:20,459 --> 00:07:23,430
to find<font color="#E5E5E5"> somebody wants your cattle so</font>

157
00:07:22,050 --> 00:07:25,470
that you can get<font color="#E5E5E5"> something that the guy</font>

158
00:07:23,430 --> 00:07:27,530
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> has a car once so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that you can buy</font>

159
00:07:25,470 --> 00:07:27,530
it

160
00:07:32,459 --> 00:07:37,620
so the solution right as if there<font color="#CCCCCC"> is one</font>

161
00:07:39,288 --> 00:07:44,240
is to do the<font color="#E5E5E5"> best you can being the</font>

162
00:07:42,348 --> 00:07:46,430
strongest version of yourself and

163
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:49,069
empowering or inspiring others the way

164
00:07:46,430 --> 00:07:51,348
you feel foot fit this day and this time

165
00:07:49,069 --> 00:07:53,149
so that you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> create a world to come</font>

166
00:07:51,348 --> 00:07:54,800
back to several generations from now

167
00:07:53,149 --> 00:07:58,519
that's a bit better<font color="#E5E5E5"> than the one you're</font>

168
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:59,538
<font color="#CCCCCC">in right now previous generations</font>

169
00:07:58,519 --> 00:08:01,068
thought they were doing the best that

170
00:07:59,538 --> 00:08:05,449
<font color="#CCCCCC">they could to create what we have right</font>

171
00:08:01,069 --> 00:08:08,960
now we could<font color="#E5E5E5"> be grateful for</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it and try</font>

172
00:08:05,449 --> 00:08:11,119
<font color="#E5E5E5">to do a better job by being the best</font>

173
00:08:08,959 --> 00:08:13,609
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we can and empowering other people</font>

174
00:08:11,119 --> 00:08:15,919
or we<font color="#E5E5E5"> could be resentful towards it and</font>

175
00:08:13,610 --> 00:08:19,069
being resentful towards it only<font color="#E5E5E5"> builds</font>

176
00:08:15,918 --> 00:08:21,498
more of what you<font color="#E5E5E5"> put out there if you're</font>

177
00:08:19,069 --> 00:08:24,369
resentful you put out more resent more

178
00:08:21,499 --> 00:08:26,569
fear more frustration more anger

179
00:08:24,369 --> 00:08:30,110
everything<font color="#E5E5E5"> that you do is going to come</font>

180
00:08:26,569 --> 00:08:31,789
from<font color="#E5E5E5"> that frequency and they're going to</font>

181
00:08:30,110 --> 00:08:34,190
come<font color="#E5E5E5"> back to a world when I say come</font>

182
00:08:31,788 --> 00:08:36,229
back<font color="#E5E5E5"> I kind of I dig</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the idea of</font>

183
00:08:34,190 --> 00:08:38,120
reincarnation I<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of dig the idea</font>

184
00:08:36,229 --> 00:08:39,589
that this thing is<font color="#CCCCCC"> just happening this</font>

185
00:08:38,120 --> 00:08:41,810
way and we do really<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't go anywhere</font>

186
00:08:39,589 --> 00:08:44,779
when we die we<font color="#E5E5E5"> just how to come back</font>

187
00:08:41,809 --> 00:08:48,049
again play this play our karma out if

188
00:08:44,778 --> 00:08:50,059
you will come<font color="#CCCCCC"> back to a world that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

189
00:08:48,049 --> 00:08:52,370
perhaps bit better than<font color="#E5E5E5"> the one that you</font>

190
00:08:50,059 --> 00:08:55,009
left because you made a decision<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> make</font>

194
00:08:58,730 --> 00:09:02,539
things like revolutions right

195
00:09:00,639 --> 00:09:03,919
