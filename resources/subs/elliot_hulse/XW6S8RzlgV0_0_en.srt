57
00:02:05,188 --> 00:02:08,579
going to be<font color="#E5E5E5"> looking for companies that</font>

58
00:02:06,390 --> 00:02:11,370
are small creative light on their feet

59
00:02:08,580 --> 00:02:13,000
they don't have time for for bullshit

60
00:02:11,370 --> 00:02:15,939
they don't have time for

61
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:19,479
for to be pandered to<font color="#CCCCCC"> by people who are</font>

they won't tolerate anything less so uh

66
00:02:25,479 --> 00:02:29,560
there's an individual who had a plan to

00:02:28,210 --> 00:02:31,390
<font color="#E5E5E5">put this business together and he's got</font>

what favorite beer he drinks right and

77
00:02:48,090 --> 00:02:53,229
then you can find a connection point

78
00:02:50,500 --> 00:02:54,729
with that person<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay that's important</font>

83
00:02:59,770 --> 00:03:04,390
anything spectacular<font color="#CCCCCC"> it has to be</font>

84
00:03:01,569 --> 00:03:06,310
something that you guys connect on next

85
00:03:04,389 --> 00:03:10,389

creative guy hold on the sun's getting

96
00:03:28,959 --> 00:03:32,769
in my eyes here he's a creative guy and

97
00:03:31,330 --> 00:03:34,570
he expects creativity from the people

98
00:03:32,769 --> 00:03:36,400

00:03:45,310 --> 00:03:48,310
<font color="#E5E5E5">about his company that you feel can be</font>

105

109
00:03:55,329 --> 00:03:58,870
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> call it a flaw but just something</font>

110
00:03:56,829 --> 00:03:59,950
that he can do better he's gonna<font color="#E5E5E5"> be</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> very</font>

111
00:03:58,870 --> 00:04:02,439

114
00:04:04,090 --> 00:04:08,349
and getting a little better so now he's

115
00:04:05,620 --> 00:04:10,780
<font color="#CCCCCC">thinking of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you as a consultant you're</font>

00:04:23,050 --> 00:04:26,590
pizza or the<font color="#CCCCCC"> the box with a gift in it</font>

123
00:04:25,839 --> 00:04:28,329
earlier

important that I want to share with you

130
00:04:38,199 --> 00:04:43,870
and he's gonna<font color="#CCCCCC"> be all ears when you meet</font>

131
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:45,459
him when you<font color="#E5E5E5"> get through the door so</font>

132
00:04:43,870 --> 00:04:47,259

133
00:04:45,459 --> 00:04:48,909
people who write resumes those guys

134
00:04:47,259 --> 00:04:51,879
they're morons they don't know how to

135
00:04:48,910 --> 00:04:53,470
appeal to human behavior psychology and

136
00:04:51,879 --> 00:04:55,478
quite frankly don't have a network

137
00:04:53,470 --> 00:04:57,070
properly so now you<font color="#E5E5E5"> gotten through the</font>

138
00:04:55,478 --> 00:04:58,509
door and you're going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> pull out that</font>

139
00:04:57,069 --> 00:05:00,129
connection point the minute you meet him

140
00:04:58,509 --> 00:05:02,259
you're going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> bring up who won the</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">bucs game or when the Mets game what are</font>

142
00:05:02,259 --> 00:05:04,810
the case may be whatever that connection
