three<font color="#E5E5E5"> years and it's an overnight</font>

14
00:00:37,950 --> 00:00:42,629
success may even how<font color="#CCCCCC"> long have you been</font>

15
00:00:40,020 --> 00:00:45,390
putting<font color="#E5E5E5"> on videos and when did you see</font>

16
00:00:42,628 --> 00:00:49,378
the real growth of your of<font color="#CCCCCC"> your business</font>

17
00:00:45,390 --> 00:00:51,509
and your youtube career dude you've been

18
00:00:49,378 --> 00:00:53,549
<font color="#E5E5E5">around long enough to know that a lot of</font>

19
00:00:51,509 --> 00:00:56,159
everything<font color="#CCCCCC"> that we're doing is brand</font>

20
00:00:53,549 --> 00:00:59,849
spanking new nothing that we're doing<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

21
00:00:56,159 --> 00:01:01,108
uh our<font color="#E5E5E5"> parents didn't do it they</font>

22
00:00:59,850 --> 00:01:04,618
couldn't taught us how to do this in

23
00:01:01,109 --> 00:01:07,349
school there was no career path for an

24
00:01:04,618 --> 00:01:10,640
internet marketer much less a YouTube

25
00:01:07,349 --> 00:01:15,359
celebrity and so when I look at my life

26
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:17,719
I look in all because it was like

27
00:01:15,359 --> 00:01:20,188
there's no way to have prepared<font color="#CCCCCC"> for this</font>

28
00:01:17,719 --> 00:01:22,950
no one could<font color="#E5E5E5"> have told me</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that when I</font>

29
00:01:20,188 --> 00:01:25,618
started filming the workouts that I was

30
00:01:22,950 --> 00:01:27,478
doing for<font color="#E5E5E5"> with my clients that I would</font>

31
00:01:25,618 --> 00:01:29,489
upload them to a platform<font color="#CCCCCC"> that people</font>

32
00:01:27,478 --> 00:01:31,109
would see them worldwide and they would

33
00:01:29,489 --> 00:01:34,109
attract the attention of millions that

34
00:01:31,109 --> 00:01:35,489
like never crossed my mind and the

35
00:01:34,109 --> 00:01:36,659
reason why I say that is because those

36
00:01:35,489 --> 00:01:38,489
of you who are in the audience I want

37
00:01:36,659 --> 00:01:40,439
you to remember<font color="#CCCCCC"> that although we</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> have</font>

38
00:01:38,489 --> 00:01:43,259
our goals we have<font color="#CCCCCC"> our plans and of</font>

39
00:01:40,438 --> 00:01:46,319
course the universe has its goals and

40
00:01:43,259 --> 00:01:50,368
plans as well we could never foresee all

41
00:01:46,319 --> 00:01:52,379
of the celestial aid that will come our

42
00:01:50,368 --> 00:01:55,640
way you know it's it I might<font color="#E5E5E5"> sound like</font>

43
00:01:52,379 --> 00:01:58,649
a hippie but uh YouTube's fucking magic

44
00:01:55,640 --> 00:02:00,060
unless you'll aid to me that's I could

45
00:01:58,649 --> 00:02:01,349
have never planned that I could<font color="#E5E5E5"> never</font>

46
00:02:00,060 --> 00:02:04,409
have asked<font color="#E5E5E5"> for it I could have never</font>

47
00:02:01,349 --> 00:02:06,179
dreamt it but the universe provided by

48
00:02:04,409 --> 00:02:08,700
giving me<font color="#E5E5E5"> a platform where my big mouth</font>

49
00:02:06,180 --> 00:02:09,780
could be heard worldwide and while

50
00:02:08,699 --> 00:02:11,219
you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> sitting there building your</font>

51
00:02:09,780 --> 00:02:14,270
business or thinking<font color="#CCCCCC"> about your future</font>

52
00:02:11,219 --> 00:02:17,099
remember<font color="#E5E5E5"> that although you can</font>

53
00:02:14,270 --> 00:02:18,990
plan the path you<font color="#CCCCCC"> can imagine the path</font>

54
00:02:17,099 --> 00:02:20,699
you could visualize the path there's

55
00:02:18,990 --> 00:02:22,350
<font color="#E5E5E5">absolutely no way that you know what the</font>

56
00:02:20,699 --> 00:02:25,079
path is going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> bryn until until you</font>

57
00:02:22,349 --> 00:02:29,579
start walking on it because magical shit

58
00:02:25,080 --> 00:02:31,709
happens awesome awesome thank you<font color="#E5E5E5"> so and</font>

59
00:02:29,580 --> 00:02:33,690
when did you see that it really took off

60
00:02:31,709 --> 00:02:35,310
and what did it<font color="#E5E5E5"> do for you enjoy I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> mean</font>

61
00:02:33,689 --> 00:02:37,409
how<font color="#E5E5E5"> long have</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you been putting on</font>

62
00:02:35,310 --> 00:02:41,159
<font color="#CCCCCC">YouTube videos for like seven years or</font>

63
00:02:37,409 --> 00:02:43,770
something yeah so I guess the reason why

64
00:02:41,159 --> 00:02:46,620
I went that direction was big with my

65
00:02:43,770 --> 00:02:49,530
<font color="#E5E5E5">answer was because you know we talked</font>

66
00:02:46,620 --> 00:02:51,360
about overnight success and then we want

67
00:02:49,530 --> 00:02:52,530
<font color="#E5E5E5">to become an overnight success and we</font>

68
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:55,050
have an idea about<font color="#E5E5E5"> what overnight</font>

69
00:02:52,530 --> 00:02:57,300
success is so we go hard<font color="#E5E5E5"> and have an</font>

70
00:02:55,050 --> 00:02:59,580
expectation for when it's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to when</font>

71
00:02:57,300 --> 00:03:02,969
it's going to manifest<font color="#CCCCCC"> itself but that's</font>

72
00:02:59,580 --> 00:03:05,940
very<font color="#E5E5E5"> rarely the case and it's been 10</font>

73
00:03:02,969 --> 00:03:07,650
<font color="#CCCCCC">years for me even five years ago I</font>

74
00:03:05,939 --> 00:03:10,530
couldn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> have predicted what I'm</font>

75
00:03:07,650 --> 00:03:12,120
experiencing right now so and<font color="#CCCCCC"> 10 years</font>

76
00:03:10,530 --> 00:03:13,590
is a drop in the bucket also you know

77
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:15,360
when you<font color="#CCCCCC"> think about our</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> parents if they</font>

78
00:03:13,590 --> 00:03:17,430
built business or grandparents or

79
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:19,049
generations before I was watching a

80
00:03:17,430 --> 00:03:21,810
documentary on the men who built america

81
00:03:19,049 --> 00:03:25,049
about<font color="#CCCCCC"> Andrew Carnegie and Rockefeller</font>

82
00:03:21,810 --> 00:03:27,479
and and and Ford and these guys they

83
00:03:25,049 --> 00:03:31,079
spent decades just<font color="#E5E5E5"> trying to get off the</font>

84
00:03:27,479 --> 00:03:33,149
ground they spent it what would be<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

85
00:03:31,079 --> 00:03:34,560
equivalent of tens of thousands or

86
00:03:33,150 --> 00:03:36,840
hundreds of thousands<font color="#E5E5E5"> or millions of</font>

87
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:38,759
dollars today just to get their ID or

88
00:03:36,840 --> 00:03:40,799
<font color="#E5E5E5">addy off the ground so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ten years</font>

89
00:03:38,759 --> 00:03:41,759
although it might sound like a long<font color="#CCCCCC"> time</font>

90
00:03:40,799 --> 00:03:44,219
<font color="#CCCCCC">to some of you guys sitting there</font>

91
00:03:41,759 --> 00:03:47,699
because we live in a microwave get

92
00:03:44,219 --> 00:03:50,969
everything now<font color="#E5E5E5"> culture and time is a</font>

93
00:03:47,699 --> 00:03:54,750
drop in the bucket and so it seems like

94
00:03:50,969 --> 00:03:57,120
it it was<font color="#CCCCCC"> just yesterday awesome awesome</font>

95
00:03:54,750 --> 00:03:59,489

104
00:04:17,189 --> 00:04:21,569
time that you didn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> get as following a</font>

105
00:04:19,379 --> 00:04:23,490
jab right now like<font color="#E5E5E5"> with negatively</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> in</font>

106
00:04:21,569 --> 00:04:27,219
all how did you stay motivating the time

107
00:04:23,490 --> 00:04:29,740
dude that's like asking as a gazelle

108
00:04:27,220 --> 00:04:42,610
how does he stay moded motivated when a

109
00:04:29,740 --> 00:04:44,710
line is chasing his ass yeah there's no

110
00:04:42,610 --> 00:04:47,860
motivation is needed when you've got the

111
00:04:44,709 --> 00:04:49,689
fear of not being able to put food on

112
00:04:47,860 --> 00:04:51,220
the table for your family you know I

113
00:04:49,689 --> 00:04:52,990
moved down<font color="#CCCCCC"> to Florida it was</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> just me and</font>

114
00:04:51,220 --> 00:04:56,110
<font color="#E5E5E5">my wife now there's six of us I have</font>

115
00:04:52,990 --> 00:04:57,519
four children so the youngest is five so

116
00:04:56,110 --> 00:04:59,259
if you could<font color="#CCCCCC"> think about the timeline I</font>

117
00:04:57,519 --> 00:05:02,019
was<font color="#CCCCCC"> building my business at the same</font>

118
00:04:59,259 --> 00:05:06,519
time that my wife and I were popping out

119
00:05:02,019 --> 00:05:09,189
babies and I had<font color="#CCCCCC"> Hills to pay yeah I</font>

120
00:05:06,519 --> 00:05:11,139
bill to pay and mouths to feed so as far

121
00:05:09,189 --> 00:05:14,469
<font color="#CCCCCC">as motivation is concerned I didn't need</font>

122
00:05:11,139 --> 00:05:19,089
any I didn't eat any motivation I just

123
00:05:14,470 --> 00:05:22,810
need the fact that survival was the only

124
00:05:19,089 --> 00:05:25,689
option<font color="#E5E5E5"> for me what I what I like about</font>

125
00:05:22,810 --> 00:05:28,509
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> is that you're an athlete you're a</font>

126
00:05:25,689 --> 00:05:30,240
businessman mature almost like the

127
00:05:28,509 --> 00:05:32,889
primary thing is you're a family man and

128
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:36,069
I mean you've<font color="#CCCCCC"> been with Colleen for like</font>

129
00:05:32,889 --> 00:05:38,740
<font color="#E5E5E5">over 20 years right 22 years yeah 22</font>

130
00:05:36,069 --> 00:05:40,719
years<font color="#CCCCCC"> and a lot of people look at you</font>

131
00:05:38,740 --> 00:05:42,759
and they will<font color="#E5E5E5"> be</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> like a cease all over</font>

132
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:46,240
the place and like outrageous and like

133
00:05:42,759 --> 00:05:48,310
smart and all this<font color="#E5E5E5"> stuff but if you know</font>

134
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:49,689
you really well you're just<font color="#E5E5E5"> really a</font>

135
00:05:48,310 --> 00:05:51,579
family<font color="#CCCCCC"> man and family is really</font>

136
00:05:49,689 --> 00:05:53,168
important to<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can you elaborate on</font>

137
00:05:51,579 --> 00:05:54,579
that a little bit<font color="#E5E5E5"> if you combine that</font>

138
00:05:53,168 --> 00:05:56,409
with the business so what does<font color="#CCCCCC"> your</font>

139
00:05:54,579 --> 00:06:01,209
business provide for your family or vice

140
00:05:56,410 --> 00:06:03,550
versa well I often quote Dan Kennedy by

141
00:06:01,209 --> 00:06:06,159
saying choose your lifestyle first and

142
00:06:03,550 --> 00:06:10,240
then build your business around it and I

143
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:13,960
truly believe that as many people admire

love for<font color="#CCCCCC"> my family</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> then that's first and</font>

158
00:06:50,259 --> 00:06:54,459

enough to know what I want<font color="#E5E5E5"> what I don't</font>

164
00:07:06,668 --> 00:07:11,498
the way that I feel they should be cared

165
00:07:09,098 --> 00:07:14,199
for you know we do a lot of

166

non-traditional parenting and and

167
00:07:14,199 --> 00:07:19,959
because we<font color="#E5E5E5"> just I decided what my core</font>

00:07:16,329 --> 00:07:22,360
values were first I decided what I love

169
00:07:19,959 --> 00:07:24,939
what my family needs and then my

170
00:07:22,360 --> 00:07:27,939

00:07:59,800 --> 00:08:06,278
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> fact that yesterday was thanksgiving</font>

189
00:08:08,139 --> 00:08:13,239
can't challenge I had a big eventful

190
00:08:09,908 --> 00:08:15,158
weekend and and I couldn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> see leaving</font>

191
00:08:13,238 --> 00:08:19,268
my children for another three four five

192
00:08:15,158 --> 00:08:21,668
days for anything that nothing could

193
00:08:19,269 --> 00:08:24,158
have told<font color="#E5E5E5"> me away and so there's just an</font>

194
00:08:21,668 --> 00:08:25,568
example of it so talk about<font color="#E5E5E5"> your core</font>

195
00:08:24,158 --> 00:08:29,218
values<font color="#CCCCCC"> with honors and how did</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

196
00:08:25,569 --> 00:08:29,218
decide<font color="#CCCCCC"> to come up with</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> those core values</font>

197
00:08:31,168 --> 00:08:38,139
well I once heard that the best way to

198
00:08:35,379 --> 00:08:42,668
know someone's core values is to look at

199
00:08:38,139 --> 00:08:45,818
their bank statement right<font color="#CCCCCC"> because</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we</font>

200
00:08:42,668 --> 00:08:47,980
can we can pay lip service to any core

201
00:08:45,818 --> 00:08:51,939
value we want and most of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the time it's</font>

202
00:08:47,980 --> 00:08:54,430
just what we aspire to which is good

203
00:08:51,940 --> 00:08:56,680
it's what we hope for and what we aim

204
00:08:54,429 --> 00:08:58,899
for but but nine times out of 10 it's

205
00:08:56,679 --> 00:09:00,939
not exactly what our core values are and

206
00:08:58,899 --> 00:09:02,500
if you're sitting<font color="#CCCCCC"> here listening to this</font>

207
00:09:00,940 --> 00:09:04,240
right<font color="#CCCCCC"> now right now</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it invite you to</font>

208
00:09:02,500 --> 00:09:06,340
pull out your october bank statement<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

209
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:08,950
look at where you spend the majority of

210
00:09:06,340 --> 00:09:10,899
your money and<font color="#E5E5E5"> if you've got abundance</font>

211
00:09:08,950 --> 00:09:13,870
if you got excess where do<font color="#E5E5E5"> you and which</font>

212
00:09:10,899 --> 00:09:16,480
we are living in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the type of societies</font>

213
00:09:13,870 --> 00:09:18,970
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> we do we've got more than our needs</font>

214
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:21,399
met so we got to look at where we spend

215
00:09:18,970 --> 00:09:23,080
lavishly right<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm not talking about</font>

216
00:09:21,399 --> 00:09:24,819
just being able to put a morsel in your

217
00:09:23,080 --> 00:09:26,410
mouth I'm talking about what kind of

218
00:09:24,820 --> 00:09:29,860
morsels do you put in your mouth so for

219
00:09:26,409 --> 00:09:33,730
example for me<font color="#E5E5E5"> I spend extra on organic</font>

220
00:09:29,860 --> 00:09:36,580
food<font color="#E5E5E5"> and supplements I soccorso hell is</font>

221
00:09:33,730 --> 00:09:37,930
a core value to me I spend extra for the

222
00:09:36,580 --> 00:09:41,259
type of water that me and my family

223
00:09:37,929 --> 00:09:43,839
drink I spend extra so that I can<font color="#E5E5E5"> have a</font>

224
00:09:41,259 --> 00:09:46,509
gym to train myself and<font color="#CCCCCC"> colleen's</font>

225
00:09:43,840 --> 00:09:48,910
actually at the gym<font color="#CCCCCC"> right now</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I spend</font>

226
00:09:46,509 --> 00:09:52,059
extra so that my family my children can

227
00:09:48,909 --> 00:09:55,000
go to gymnastics lessons I spend extra

228
00:09:52,059 --> 00:09:57,369
on their health I spend extra on my

229
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:59,500
health so health and fitness is a top

230
00:09:57,370 --> 00:10:01,659
priority for me it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> been my experience</font>

231
00:09:59,500 --> 00:10:03,759
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> I truly believe in pain and I'm</font>

232
00:10:01,659 --> 00:10:06,100
<font color="#CCCCCC">convinced that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we cannot live the life</font>

233
00:10:03,759 --> 00:10:07,750
of our dreams we cannot be the strongest

234
00:10:06,100 --> 00:10:10,230
versions of ourselves we cannot fulfill

235
00:10:07,750 --> 00:10:13,269
our potential if we're ill if we're not

236
00:10:10,230 --> 00:10:16,450
healthy if we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> not vibrant vital and</font>

237
00:10:13,269 --> 00:10:18,819
buzzing with sexual energy which is is

238
00:10:16,450 --> 00:10:20,530
bodily energy there's exercise it's

239
00:10:18,820 --> 00:10:25,540
eating well so that's why at the top of

240
00:10:20,529 --> 00:10:27,759
the list and and and<font color="#CCCCCC"> I could continue by</font>

anything except itself meaning that it

289
00:12:40,528 --> 00:12:47,189
really is subjective and when we're

290
00:12:44,429 --> 00:12:48,689
entrepreneurs were also artists when

we're building businesses especially the

fitness for philosophy for business for

obviously going to more<font color="#CCCCCC"> than likely come</font>

298
00:13:04,649 --> 00:13:10,799

deep desire<font color="#CCCCCC"> and a love within</font>

creating something out of nothing when

you're done denying the universe its

negativity to color your attitude and

00:14:45,590 --> 00:14:49,940
behavior<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think one of the worst</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> things</font>

338
00:14:48,440 --> 00:14:51,410
you can do with an entrepreneur but also

339
00:14:49,940 --> 00:14:54,080
the worst thing that you can do as an

340
00:14:51,409 --> 00:14:56,299
artist is to adapt to the negative

341
00:14:54,080 --> 00:14:59,180
<font color="#E5E5E5">comments or adapt to the people who</font>

at the death to people that don't dig it

344
00:15:02,419 --> 00:15:06,979
and that that way their art becomes

345
00:15:04,669 --> 00:15:09,889
average and it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> I think it's one of the</font>

346
00:15:06,980 --> 00:15:12,289
<font color="#E5E5E5">worst things you can do so never adapt</font>

00:15:09,889 --> 00:15:13,519
to people or hating on you whatever just

348
00:15:12,289 --> 00:15:15,500
be yourself and that's<font color="#CCCCCC"> what I love about</font>

King warrior magician lover idea where

384
00:16:55,629 --> 00:16:59,769
it comes from those you studied

00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:02,139
psychology you may be familiar with call

386
00:16:59,769 --> 00:17:04,509
young call<font color="#E5E5E5"> young was a student of</font>

387
00:17:02,139 --> 00:17:06,459
Sigmund Freud but he was it was of the

388
00:17:04,509 --> 00:17:09,359
mystical mindset meaning<font color="#E5E5E5"> that like his</font>

389
00:17:06,459 --> 00:17:14,500
psychology methods revolved around

390
00:17:09,359 --> 00:17:17,169
symbology dream interpretation symbol

391
00:17:14,500 --> 00:17:20,318
interpretation story and mythology

392
00:17:17,170 --> 00:17:22,900
interpretation and and he recognized a

393
00:17:20,318 --> 00:17:26,369
cross cultural reference or a recurring

394
00:17:22,900 --> 00:17:29,080
theme he would call these archetypes in

395
00:17:26,369 --> 00:17:32,219
<font color="#E5E5E5">mythology and religion and philosophy</font>

396
00:17:29,079 --> 00:17:34,269
and even in movies even<font color="#CCCCCC"> in pop culture</font>

397
00:17:32,220 --> 00:17:38,819
we see a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot of these recur</font>

398
00:17:34,269 --> 00:17:43,180
<font color="#E5E5E5">bring themes Joseph Campbell who is also</font>

these archetypes the hero's<font color="#CCCCCC"> journey and</font>

401
00:17:45,940 --> 00:17:49,330
we're familiar with the hero's journey

402
00:17:47,319 --> 00:17:53,859
because we watch movies like Star<font color="#CCCCCC"> Wars</font>

403
00:17:49,329 --> 00:17:56,710
<font color="#E5E5E5">and the matrix and what someone with</font>

404
00:17:53,859 --> 00:17:57,909
bilbo baggins The Hobbit and things like

405
00:17:56,710 --> 00:18:00,880
that so<font color="#E5E5E5"> we're familiar with this</font>

406
00:17:57,910 --> 00:18:02,620
recurring motif interesting thing about

407
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:04,710
the hero's journey is that it's also a

408
00:18:02,619 --> 00:18:10,089
recurring<font color="#E5E5E5"> motif in our individual lives</font>

409
00:18:04,710 --> 00:18:12,519
so that's an aside young also<font color="#E5E5E5"> had</font>

another student by the name of Robert

412
00:18:16,740 --> 00:18:21,640
maybe like in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> 80s or 70s basically</font>

413
00:18:19,720 --> 00:18:24,480
when men started taking back their love

414
00:18:21,640 --> 00:18:28,650
started taking back their spirituality

415
00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:31,900
and kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of started dropping the hard</font>

shell or armor that we've been taught to

417
00:18:31,900 --> 00:18:38,310
carry for so many generations he

418
00:18:34,420 --> 00:18:38,310
realized that men are far more than just

419
00:18:39,059 --> 00:18:48,779
what is portrayed in<font color="#CCCCCC"> popular culture as</font>

examples of what a masculine mature

masculine is so more dis discovered that

and sovereign characteristics and

these equal quarters your magician is

442
00:19:52,628 --> 00:19:57,519
very much tied to what you guys<font color="#E5E5E5"> are</font>

00:20:03,519 --> 00:20:07,808
objectivity and spirituality higher

447
00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:09,729
thinking intuition things of that nature

also<font color="#E5E5E5"> mention lover the lover aspect of</font>

460
00:20:36,970 --> 00:20:45,429
us the lover aspect is often lost

461
00:20:41,788 --> 00:20:47,048
through a disconnect with our sensuality

462
00:20:45,429 --> 00:20:48,788
that's the very first thing that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'd</font>

463
00:20:47,048 --> 00:20:50,589
like<font color="#E5E5E5"> to share</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> because that's a that's</font>

464
00:20:48,788 --> 00:20:52,419
one<font color="#E5E5E5"> that I think</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> can heal us all is</font>

465
00:20:50,589 --> 00:20:58,269
getting<font color="#CCCCCC"> in touch with our feelings right</font>

466
00:20:52,419 --> 00:21:02,259
so we were<font color="#CCCCCC"> in balanced when we can't</font>

467
00:20:58,269 --> 00:21:04,778
feel sad when we can't cry when we can't

468
00:21:02,259 --> 00:21:07,419
laughs ecstatically when we can't<font color="#CCCCCC"> find</font>

469
00:21:04,778 --> 00:21:09,848
ourselves able to get<font color="#E5E5E5"> angry when</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we</font>

470
00:21:07,419 --> 00:21:12,129
should get angry<font color="#CCCCCC"> you know some of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> us are</font>

471
00:21:09,848 --> 00:21:14,108
are so disassociated that we're

472
00:21:12,128 --> 00:21:16,449
ambivalent most of our lives and that's

473
00:21:14,108 --> 00:21:18,638
um that's a wound in the lover category

474
00:21:16,450 --> 00:21:22,450
when we heal our lover we have the

475
00:21:18,638 --> 00:21:26,258
ability to to love to love ourselves

476
00:21:22,450 --> 00:21:29,590
enough to experience the sensuality of

477
00:21:26,259 --> 00:21:31,778
life and share sensuality with other

478
00:21:29,589 --> 00:21:34,418
people meaning sexuality and love in

479
00:21:31,778 --> 00:21:37,679
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> way but also communion community</font>

480
00:21:34,419 --> 00:21:41,139
you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> various different types of</font>

481
00:21:37,679 --> 00:21:43,359
intimacy with self and other and then

482
00:21:41,138 --> 00:21:45,128
the warrior which is kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the</font>

483
00:21:43,358 --> 00:21:46,388
opposite of the lover in many ways but

484
00:21:45,128 --> 00:21:49,778
they need each other in order<font color="#E5E5E5"> to balance</font>

485
00:21:46,388 --> 00:21:57,329
your warrior aspect is very much related

486
00:21:49,778 --> 00:22:00,700
to boundaries and creative aggression

487
00:21:57,329 --> 00:22:01,720
the type of aggression that arises in a

488
00:22:00,700 --> 00:22:03,789
balanced

489
00:22:01,720 --> 00:22:06,509
mature warrior is the type of aggression

490
00:22:03,789 --> 00:22:11,200
that helps us want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to protect children</font>

491
00:22:06,509 --> 00:22:12,910
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know that feeling that it's our</font>

492
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:15,460
responsibility to do right for people

493
00:22:12,910 --> 00:22:17,650
<font color="#CCCCCC">who can't take care of themselves the</font>

494
00:22:15,460 --> 00:22:19,660
discipline the discipline associated

495
00:22:17,650 --> 00:22:22,180
with the warrior also makes us get up

496
00:22:19,660 --> 00:22:24,759
every day to do the thing that we set

497
00:22:22,180 --> 00:22:27,850
out<font color="#CCCCCC"> to do especially if the sovereign</font>

498
00:22:24,759 --> 00:22:29,289
aspect of ourselves has a vision you get

499
00:22:27,849 --> 00:22:30,549
<font color="#E5E5E5">up every</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> day well that vision is</font>

500
00:22:29,289 --> 00:22:33,700
important you get<font color="#E5E5E5"> up every day because</font>

501
00:22:30,549 --> 00:22:35,169
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> said you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> were going to and that's</font>

502
00:22:33,700 --> 00:22:36,850
what a warrior does he does what he's

503
00:22:35,170 --> 00:22:39,160
supposed to do whether he likes it or

504
00:22:36,849 --> 00:22:40,869
not because he's associated with

505
00:22:39,160 --> 00:22:45,370
discipline he's also associated with

506
00:22:40,869 --> 00:22:48,069
boundaries a a person a man or<font color="#CCCCCC"> a woman</font>

507
00:22:45,369 --> 00:22:49,989
<font color="#CCCCCC">would have a hard time</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> even accessing</font>

508
00:22:48,069 --> 00:22:52,480
their lover if they couldn't protect

509
00:22:49,990 --> 00:22:54,849
their lover with boundaries meaning<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

510
00:22:52,480 --> 00:22:56,920
the warrior has to<font color="#E5E5E5"> say no sometimes like</font>

511
00:22:54,849 --> 00:22:59,769
so for example my love for my family<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

512
00:22:56,920 --> 00:23:03,720
my love for myself a lot cause my

513
00:22:59,769 --> 00:23:07,059
warrior to exorcise him self by<font color="#CCCCCC"> that by</font>

514
00:23:03,720 --> 00:23:09,940
asserting that I would not<font color="#E5E5E5"> be attending</font>

515
00:23:07,059 --> 00:23:11,740
this conference live as<font color="#E5E5E5"> much as I would</font>

516
00:23:09,940 --> 00:23:14,529
like to my warrior had to set up a

517
00:23:11,740 --> 00:23:16,870
boundary and say hey man if you're going

518
00:23:14,529 --> 00:23:18,490
to be the king and<font color="#CCCCCC"> the magician and</font>

519
00:23:16,869 --> 00:23:20,169
really protect your lover then your

520
00:23:18,490 --> 00:23:23,589
warrior needs to stand up<font color="#CCCCCC"> and say no</font>

521
00:23:20,170 --> 00:23:24,759
when it's time to<font color="#E5E5E5"> say no so I don't</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know</font>

522
00:23:23,589 --> 00:23:28,059
<font color="#CCCCCC">if</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that answers our question but I</font>

523
00:23:24,759 --> 00:23:31,390
wanted<font color="#E5E5E5"> to give a big overview of this</font>

524
00:23:28,059 --> 00:23:34,179
aspect of relating to ourselves relating

525
00:23:31,390 --> 00:23:37,750
to our egos and and realizing that when

526
00:23:34,180 --> 00:23:39,880
<font color="#E5E5E5">we find ourselves not enjoying life when</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">this wisdom is of such a high order the</font>

like how<font color="#CCCCCC"> can i almost like unleash my</font>

543
00:24:32,220 --> 00:24:38,490
inner warrior that was sort of a

544
00:24:33,630 --> 00:24:43,050
question<font color="#CCCCCC"> where times the right Linus</font>

545
00:24:38,490 --> 00:24:44,940
yeah well the warrior carries 22 thing's

546
00:24:43,049 --> 00:24:47,819
for sure that you know warriors going to

547
00:24:44,940 --> 00:24:50,070
have he's going to have a sword right

548
00:24:47,819 --> 00:24:51,509
and he's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to have a shield of</font>

549
00:24:50,069 --> 00:24:53,069
course you know it could be it could be

550
00:24:51,509 --> 00:24:54,720
a bulletproof jacket and<font color="#E5E5E5"> it can</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> be a</font>

551
00:24:53,069 --> 00:24:56,429
<font color="#CCCCCC">newsie it doesn't matter the fact is</font>

552
00:24:54,720 --> 00:25:00,210
he's got<font color="#E5E5E5"> a weapon that reaches out and</font>

553
00:24:56,430 --> 00:25:02,700
he's got a protective mechanism that's

554
00:25:00,210 --> 00:25:05,069
associated with him and<font color="#E5E5E5"> any time</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we are</font>

555
00:25:02,700 --> 00:25:06,860
and i like to use that metaphor so we

556
00:25:05,069 --> 00:25:09,659
can always<font color="#E5E5E5"> look at whether or not we are</font>

00:25:06,859 --> 00:25:11,729
<font color="#E5E5E5">building something doing something being</font>

558
00:25:09,660 --> 00:25:14,100
aggressive aggressive is one of these

559
00:25:11,730 --> 00:25:15,599
beautiful words that has also received a

560
00:25:14,099 --> 00:25:17,219
lot of negative association with it

561
00:25:15,599 --> 00:25:19,230
because it sounds like beating people up

562
00:25:17,220 --> 00:25:21,329
or fighting or<font color="#E5E5E5"> yelling when really</font>

563
00:25:19,230 --> 00:25:23,910
aggression is the opposite of regression

564
00:25:21,329 --> 00:25:25,439
meaning it's the moving forward anytime

565
00:25:23,910 --> 00:25:27,509
you want<font color="#CCCCCC"> to you're trying to move</font>

around for lifestyle and we also

because he's got small ones you ain't

624
00:28:09,929 --> 00:28:14,580
sleeping like you you think you should

625
00:28:11,789 --> 00:28:16,109
write so you might plan for what you're

626

<font color="#CCCCCC">going to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> be doing you might have all</font>

627
00:28:16,109 --> 00:28:21,139
these grand ideas and creativity<font color="#E5E5E5"> which</font>

628
00:28:18,750 --> 00:28:24,150
when you wake up after a long night

629
00:28:21,140 --> 00:28:25,740
dealing<font color="#CCCCCC"> with a child you chose not to</font>

630
00:28:24,150 --> 00:28:27,750
sleep<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> night for whatever reason</font>

631
00:28:25,740 --> 00:28:30,118
sometimes<font color="#E5E5E5"> your plans go out the window</font>

632
00:28:27,750 --> 00:28:32,298
so<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

633
00:28:30,118 --> 00:28:36,298
one of the things<font color="#E5E5E5"> I've had</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to learn was</font>

634
00:28:32,298 --> 00:28:40,828
to be flexible flexible enough to react

635
00:28:36,298 --> 00:28:44,189
on the fly<font color="#E5E5E5"> but also be aware that what</font>

636
00:28:40,828 --> 00:28:47,638
you think our rituals and habits that

637
00:28:44,189 --> 00:28:52,288
will carry towards your success they to

638
00:28:47,638 --> 00:28:54,448
also<font color="#E5E5E5"> have to be adjusted to in order to</font>

639
00:28:52,288 --> 00:28:56,038
deal with your family in order<font color="#CCCCCC"> to love</font>

640
00:28:54,449 --> 00:28:58,919
your family and to<font color="#E5E5E5"> honor your family so</font>

641
00:28:56,038 --> 00:29:01,979
for example I'll say this the past four

642
00:28:58,919 --> 00:29:03,659
<font color="#CCCCCC">days today's my first day back in my</font>

643
00:29:01,979 --> 00:29:07,528
office the past four<font color="#CCCCCC"> days we were</font>

644
00:29:03,659 --> 00:29:09,659
sleeping<font color="#E5E5E5"> in tents outdoors in Florida</font>

645
00:29:07,528 --> 00:29:14,308
it's still pretty warm so we go camping

646
00:29:09,659 --> 00:29:16,619
and so my children and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'll were out at</font>

647
00:29:14,308 --> 00:29:18,449
<font color="#CCCCCC">the beach where the park all day and all</font>

648
00:29:16,618 --> 00:29:20,418
night long sleeping in a tent getting up

649
00:29:18,449 --> 00:29:24,449
the next morning lighting fires

650
00:29:20,419 --> 00:29:27,949
barbecuing all of which takes time away

651
00:29:24,449 --> 00:29:30,449
from my business right and like you said

652
00:29:27,949 --> 00:29:32,009
before<font color="#E5E5E5"> and like I said before you got to</font>

653
00:29:30,449 --> 00:29:34,139
<font color="#E5E5E5">build your lifestyle around your</font>

654
00:29:32,009 --> 00:29:36,118
business so I knew very<font color="#CCCCCC"> early on</font>

655
00:29:34,138 --> 00:29:38,488
especially since the internet was a gift

656
00:29:36,118 --> 00:29:40,468
that we all got it during high life our

657
00:29:38,489 --> 00:29:43,499
lifetimes that I was going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to build a</font>

658
00:29:40,469 --> 00:29:45,449
business it allows<font color="#CCCCCC"> me to work and when I</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">say work it's like look I spent 15</font>

660
00:29:45,449 --> 00:29:49,889
minutes in the morning<font color="#E5E5E5"> just shit</font>

661
00:29:47,699 --> 00:29:52,229
answering some emails and me and I wrote

662
00:29:49,888 --> 00:29:53,668
one blog post now making this video<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's</font>

664
00:29:53,669 --> 00:30:01,339
this so I try to I try to integrate it

665
00:29:58,348 --> 00:30:04,348
into my lifestyle if I can get up an

666
00:30:01,338 --> 00:30:06,269
hour earlier while still spending time

667
00:30:04,348 --> 00:30:08,249
with my children to do my little bit of

668
00:30:06,269 --> 00:30:11,068
work<font color="#CCCCCC"> to keep the plate spinning then I'm</font>

669
00:30:08,249 --> 00:30:13,199
fulfilling on that obligation of family

670
00:30:11,068 --> 00:30:17,938
first lifestyle first and then business

goes around it thank you<font color="#CCCCCC"> thank you over</font>

672
00:30:17,939 --> 00:30:22,349

673
00:30:19,189 --> 00:30:24,739
anybody else yeah over there so we'll

674
00:30:22,348 --> 00:30:24,739
start<font color="#CCCCCC"> here</font>

675
00:30:27,440 --> 00:30:32,269
hey Elliot I was wondering<font color="#CCCCCC"> what did you</font>

676
00:30:29,839 --> 00:30:34,579
learn about your titles your<font color="#CCCCCC"> YouTube</font>

677
00:30:32,269 --> 00:30:36,980
video<font color="#E5E5E5"> titles during the years is there a</font>

678
00:30:34,579 --> 00:30:40,099
certain strategy you apply to both

679
00:30:36,980 --> 00:30:43,519
singing and would soon divers so I'm

680
00:30:40,099 --> 00:30:46,009
going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to give you bad advice I guess</font>

681
00:30:43,519 --> 00:30:47,599
because<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is not the norm and I say</font>

682
00:30:46,009 --> 00:30:48,829
bad advice only because this is not<font color="#E5E5E5"> what</font>

683
00:30:47,599 --> 00:30:51,019
everyone else is doing is what I'm<font color="#CCCCCC"> doing</font>

684
00:30:48,829 --> 00:30:55,490
it was working for me but it might be

685
00:30:51,019 --> 00:30:57,620
<font color="#CCCCCC">good advice</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> for you I a friend of mine</font>

686
00:30:55,490 --> 00:30:59,450
just<font color="#CCCCCC"> told me he spent several thousand</font>

687
00:30:57,619 --> 00:31:01,008
dollars going to a YouTube workshop by

688
00:30:59,450 --> 00:31:03,259
the way I was like dude I'm your best

689
00:31:01,009 --> 00:31:07,190
friend and you should<font color="#CCCCCC"> just</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> ask me but he</font>

690
00:31:03,259 --> 00:31:08,149
wanted<font color="#E5E5E5"> to get a different perspective he</font>

691
00:31:07,190 --> 00:31:09,740
wanted<font color="#E5E5E5"> to get a different perspective</font>

692
00:31:08,148 --> 00:31:11,028
which I admire and I was like that's

693
00:31:09,740 --> 00:31:12,470
good because I should probably get some

694
00:31:11,028 --> 00:31:14,569
new perspectives also so he<font color="#E5E5E5"> went to a</font>

695
00:31:12,470 --> 00:31:16,460
workshop or hired a coach to show him

696
00:31:14,569 --> 00:31:21,349
how<font color="#CCCCCC"> to get more views for</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> YouTube by</font>

697
00:31:16,460 --> 00:31:24,200
using keywords and and video titles in

698
00:31:21,349 --> 00:31:27,378
order to rank in essen youtube SEO very

699
00:31:24,200 --> 00:31:31,429
good idea<font color="#E5E5E5"> I never did it nor will I ever</font>

700
00:31:27,378 --> 00:31:34,128
do it because my top videos have titles

701
00:31:31,429 --> 00:31:39,110
that read like email subject lines or

702
00:31:34,128 --> 00:31:41,058
sales letter headlines my video titles

703
00:31:39,109 --> 00:31:44,508
<font color="#CCCCCC">and the way I go about it my</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> video</font>

704
00:31:41,058 --> 00:31:46,759
titles and my thumbnail have one job and

705
00:31:44,509 --> 00:31:49,069
one job only and that is to get a

706
00:31:46,759 --> 00:31:51,860
freaking click so if you're a subscriber

707

things that I've learned is to first

781
00:35:28,889 --> 00:35:36,009
take a deep breath and create space

782
00:35:32,550 --> 00:35:38,560
between myself and someone who comes

783
00:35:36,010 --> 00:35:41,920
<font color="#E5E5E5">with negative</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> energy be it someone with</font>

and breathing stopping<font color="#CCCCCC"> for a moment and</font>

789
00:35:59,489 --> 00:36:04,629
looking at that<font color="#CCCCCC"> person that isn't as a</font>

person who's coming to hurt me or

791
00:36:04,630 --> 00:36:09,400
someone who's coming to spread negative

792
00:36:07,929 --> 00:36:11,409
vibes in my life because<font color="#E5E5E5"> oftentimes</font>

793

we're reactive in that way it's like you

lash out but I found that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I learned</font>

796
00:36:15,099 --> 00:36:21,789
quite a bit about the other person and

797
00:36:18,579 --> 00:36:23,920
about myself when<font color="#CCCCCC"> I take those take</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

00:36:21,789 --> 00:36:27,909
negative energy neutralizing with space

799
00:36:23,920 --> 00:36:30,909
and then<font color="#E5E5E5"> ask what is it that's bothering</font>

800
00:36:27,909 --> 00:36:35,109
you or what is this<font color="#E5E5E5"> all about and I</font>

801
00:36:30,909 --> 00:36:36,789
learn from them I learn what's going on

802
00:36:35,110 --> 00:36:38,530
in their heart and learn what's going on

803
00:36:36,789 --> 00:36:40,840
in their mind I also<font color="#E5E5E5"> learn how I'm</font>

804
00:36:38,530 --> 00:36:42,480
showing up so that they receive me a

805
00:36:40,840 --> 00:36:45,700
certain<font color="#E5E5E5"> way</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> so there's learning</font>

00:36:42,480 --> 00:36:47,119
experiences through people all over the

place look at people who make miss

look at our parents<font color="#CCCCCC"> or we look at</font>

810
00:36:52,639 --> 00:36:56,538
religion that we grew<font color="#CCCCCC"> up with right you</font>

811
00:36:55,130 --> 00:36:58,720
know it might<font color="#CCCCCC"> be different in your</font>

812
00:36:56,539 --> 00:37:01,490
country but a lot of<font color="#E5E5E5"> us grew up with</font>

813
00:36:58,719 --> 00:37:04,159
religion Christianity kind of pushed on

814
00:37:01,489 --> 00:37:06,169
us but then when we grow up we can grow

815
00:37:04,159 --> 00:37:10,489
resentful we're resentful of our parents

816
00:37:06,170 --> 00:37:11,960
<font color="#CCCCCC">for making us wear ugly clothes or</font>

817
00:37:10,489 --> 00:37:13,578
making us go to school or whatever

818
00:37:11,960 --> 00:37:15,170
there's all kinds of resentment in

819
00:37:13,579 --> 00:37:17,390
there's resentment towards religion and

820
00:37:15,170 --> 00:37:19,190
things of that nature<font color="#E5E5E5"> but as an adult if</font>

821
00:37:17,389 --> 00:37:22,098
you look back and you have a and you

822
00:37:19,190 --> 00:37:24,740
create<font color="#CCCCCC"> that space</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and you allow yourself</font>

823
00:37:22,099 --> 00:37:26,990
to be completely<font color="#E5E5E5"> objective no feelings</font>

824
00:37:24,739 --> 00:37:30,199
at all and you look at<font color="#E5E5E5"> those experiences</font>

825
00:37:26,989 --> 00:37:32,808
you really have to acknowledge how we

826
00:37:30,199 --> 00:37:35,259
are who we are today<font color="#E5E5E5"> all the gifts and</font>

827
00:37:32,809 --> 00:37:39,440
<font color="#E5E5E5">blessings that we have today come from</font>

potentially I don't even<font color="#E5E5E5"> say potentially</font>

829
00:37:39,440 --> 00:37:45,409
I want to say from negatively coloring

00:37:41,719 --> 00:37:49,459
<font color="#E5E5E5">are are negatively colored experiences</font>

831
00:37:45,409 --> 00:37:50,838
from our past negative is a judgment so

832
00:37:49,460 --> 00:37:52,278
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> course I'm being a little bit of a</font>

philosopher and I'm ranting I'm talking

834
00:37:52,278 --> 00:37:55,809
in circles right now but<font color="#CCCCCC"> my point is</font>

835
00:37:53,659 --> 00:37:58,670
that negative people negative

836
00:37:55,809 --> 00:38:01,999
experiences people who are smaller than

00:38:28,940 --> 00:38:35,679
years although he's been dead for 200

847
00:38:32,510 --> 00:38:40,700
years Ralph Waldo Emerson has left us a

848
00:38:35,679 --> 00:38:43,069
cache of poems and essays that like even

849
00:38:40,699 --> 00:38:47,118
when I'm feeling lost today I go back

850
00:38:43,070 --> 00:38:50,059
and I read his words loud so who's the

851
00:38:47,119 --> 00:38:52,700
founder of Taoism there's so much wisdom

852

to be learned by<font color="#E5E5E5"> by brilliant people</font>

853
00:38:52,699 --> 00:38:59,960
dead and alive that it just it makes

854
00:38:57,860 --> 00:39:02,660
<font color="#E5E5E5">life that much more</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> beautiful and gives</font>

855
00:38:59,960 --> 00:39:05,920
us tools to navigate and build in a way

856
00:39:02,659 --> 00:39:05,920
that we personally want<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

857
00:39:09,769 --> 00:39:22,380
so too<font color="#E5E5E5"> much</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is too much oxygen 1111 so</font>

858
00:39:14,639 --> 00:39:25,108

dream come true<font color="#E5E5E5"> and and I mean that</font>

863
00:39:35,579 --> 00:39:40,289
literally like I dreamt it I remember

864
00:39:38,219 --> 00:39:43,980
dreaming this I remember coming up with

865
00:39:40,289 --> 00:39:47,219
it five six seven<font color="#CCCCCC"> years</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> ago and and</font>

866
00:39:43,980 --> 00:39:50,550
standing<font color="#CCCCCC"> there amongst</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the hundred and</font>

867

<font color="#E5E5E5">seventy athletes the thousand people in</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">attendance having my wife there and my</font>

869
00:39:54,269 --> 00:40:03,858
whole team and being just awestruck that

870
00:40:00,469 --> 00:40:06,179
yet another dream of mine has come true

871
00:40:03,858 --> 00:40:08,098
so supportive people who are listening

872
00:40:06,179 --> 00:40:09,989
what did you do with one loss of

873
00:40:08,099 --> 00:40:11,970
strength camp challenge and can you<font color="#E5E5E5"> talk</font>

874
00:40:09,989 --> 00:40:15,858
a little bit what it is and why it was a

875
00:40:11,969 --> 00:40:19,799
dream for<font color="#E5E5E5"> you and how</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I wanted it well</font>

876
00:40:15,858 --> 00:40:23,098
the truth is about six years ago five

877
00:40:19,800 --> 00:40:25,710
years ago maybe I tried<font color="#CCCCCC"> out for the</font>

878
00:40:23,099 --> 00:40:28,170
CrossFit Games I'm not cut out for

879
00:40:25,710 --> 00:40:30,990
CrossFit apparently because I didn't

880
00:40:28,170 --> 00:40:32,550
score so well so I got upset<font color="#E5E5E5"> and I said</font>

881
00:40:30,989 --> 00:40:33,868
to<font color="#CCCCCC"> myself I'm going to create my own</font>

882
00:40:32,550 --> 00:40:35,849
competition but it's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be a</font>

883
00:40:33,869 --> 00:40:38,039
strength camp challenge and it's going

884
00:40:35,849 --> 00:40:41,430
<font color="#E5E5E5">to involve a good combination of</font>

885
00:40:38,039 --> 00:40:43,730
strength<font color="#E5E5E5"> and power some conditioning you</font>

886
00:40:41,429 --> 00:40:47,489
know but a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of strength and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> power and</font>

887
00:40:43,730 --> 00:40:48,990
and of course like with and I say this

888
00:40:47,489 --> 00:40:50,759
because those of you who are in the

889
00:40:48,989 --> 00:40:54,899
audience who are planting seeds right

890

892
00:40:58,320 --> 00:41:02,550
but I planted the seed of putting

893
00:40:59,849 --> 00:41:04,950
together this thing and and it came to

894
00:41:02,550 --> 00:41:07,080
fruition we had one last year which was

895
00:41:04,949 --> 00:41:08,969
