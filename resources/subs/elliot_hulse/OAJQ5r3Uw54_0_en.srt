and my brothers got real strong real

127
00:04:39,060 --> 00:04:43,259

128
00:04:41,250 --> 00:04:44,908

faster i could do push-ups I could do

134
00:04:54,209 --> 00:05:00,629
sit-ups and I guess that molded my

135
00:04:57,240 --> 00:05:02,848
character yet as it would for anyone for

136

00:05:20,668 --> 00:05:25,799
like beaten the school record by like a

147
00:05:23,009 --> 00:05:27,780
full you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> 20-plus seconds or</font>

148
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:30,509
something like that and it's funny

149
00:05:27,779 --> 00:05:32,369
because<font color="#E5E5E5"> I I'm definitely not that strong</font>

150
00:05:30,509 --> 00:05:34,829
right now<font color="#CCCCCC"> I mean</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> which is largely a</font>

151
00:05:32,370 --> 00:05:35,519
result of lifestyle<font color="#E5E5E5"> and stuff like that</font>

152
00:05:34,829 --> 00:05:37,050
versus

153
00:05:35,519 --> 00:05:39,060
genetics but it's kind of funny to see

154
00:05:37,050 --> 00:05:41,129
that the genetics were there still are

155
00:05:39,060 --> 00:05:42,418
<font color="#CCCCCC">there buried under as i like to say the</font>

156
00:05:41,129 --> 00:05:45,449
<font color="#E5E5E5">six-pack</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that i have is in the</font>

157
00:05:42,418 --> 00:05:47,339
refrigerator um but why<font color="#CCCCCC"> is it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so</font>

158
00:05:45,449 --> 00:05:48,750
important to you to<font color="#CCCCCC"> become stronger both</font>

159
00:05:47,339 --> 00:05:50,189
mentally and physically I mean you have

160
00:05:48,750 --> 00:05:51,810
what we call different levels of

161
00:05:50,189 --> 00:05:55,139
strength and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I definitely want to get</font>

162
00:05:51,810 --> 00:05:56,699
<font color="#E5E5E5">into that but why is it so important to</font>

163
00:05:55,139 --> 00:05:58,139
you to stay that<font color="#E5E5E5"> way yeah you were</font>

164
00:05:56,699 --> 00:06:00,598
stronger<font color="#E5E5E5"> when you were little so as I</font>

165
00:05:58,139 --> 00:06:02,400
why<font color="#E5E5E5"> did you stay that way well the very</font>

166
00:06:00,598 --> 00:06:04,769
person yet understand is I've come to

167
00:06:02,399 --> 00:06:07,079
use the word strength and the idea of

168
00:06:04,769 --> 00:06:09,508
<font color="#E5E5E5">growing stronger as a metaphor for</font>

169
00:06:07,079 --> 00:06:13,439
self-actualization personal development

170
00:06:09,509 --> 00:06:16,020
<font color="#E5E5E5">and because I came into my own and I</font>

171
00:06:13,439 --> 00:06:18,360
began presenting myself to the world if

172
00:06:16,019 --> 00:06:20,490
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> will through the medium of strength</font>

173
00:06:18,360 --> 00:06:22,288
that it has always been my calling card

174
00:06:20,490 --> 00:06:25,079
I was a strength coach I was in strength

175
00:06:22,288 --> 00:06:28,139
athlete and I own a gym and so on<font color="#E5E5E5"> and so</font>

176
00:06:25,079 --> 00:06:31,379
forth but as I baval Dan my message has

177
00:06:28,139 --> 00:06:33,269
evolved association with strength and

178
00:06:31,379 --> 00:06:36,389
what it actually means when I say it has

179
00:06:33,269 --> 00:06:38,549
evolved when<font color="#CCCCCC"> I say grow stronger and</font>

180
00:06:36,389 --> 00:06:40,079
<font color="#E5E5E5">become a stronger version of yourself it</font>

181
00:06:38,550 --> 00:06:42,569
means on multiple different layers

182
00:06:40,079 --> 00:06:44,519
multiple different levels not just your

183
00:06:42,569 --> 00:06:45,750
normal scalar strength which I often

184
00:06:44,519 --> 00:06:48,689
talk about and that has<font color="#CCCCCC"> to do with</font>

185
00:06:45,750 --> 00:06:50,668
muscular balance and your<font color="#E5E5E5"> structural</font>

186
00:06:48,689 --> 00:06:53,430
integrity and your your work capacity

187
00:06:50,668 --> 00:06:56,310
<font color="#CCCCCC">your yourself</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> as an athlete yourself as</font>

188
00:06:53,430 --> 00:07:00,449
a fully functional walking human being

189
00:06:56,310 --> 00:07:02,908
and I often say and truly believe<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

190
00:07:00,449 --> 00:07:05,879
your body is your mind and if you are

191
00:07:02,908 --> 00:07:07,949
sick decrepit<font color="#E5E5E5"> broken down and weak</font>

192
00:07:05,879 --> 00:07:12,000
physically I don't think you'll be able

193
00:07:07,949 --> 00:07:14,699
<font color="#CCCCCC">to reach your maximum capacity on a</font>

194
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:17,038
cognitive mental spiritual level so I

195
00:07:14,699 --> 00:07:19,139
begin there I begin with the body but it

196
00:07:17,038 --> 00:07:20,939
goes far beyond that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we're also</font>

197
00:07:19,139 --> 00:07:22,650
considering the physiological strength

198
00:07:20,939 --> 00:07:24,689
of an individual<font color="#E5E5E5"> or the physiological</font>

00:07:22,649 --> 00:07:27,448
health of an individual their organs or

200
00:07:24,689 --> 00:07:29,490
hormones the nervous system and then

201
00:07:27,449 --> 00:07:31,110
ultimately their psychology the way you

202
00:07:29,490 --> 00:07:33,478
think the stories you tell yourself the

203
00:07:31,110 --> 00:07:36,810
way you carry your body as a

204
00:07:33,478 --> 00:07:38,189
manifestation of the psychological

205
00:07:36,810 --> 00:07:39,839
character that you're carrying<font color="#CCCCCC"> yourself</font>

in the world and they're physically

moving forward<font color="#E5E5E5"> because you know they're</font>

on their toes and their head is held

will physically they're not going<font color="#CCCCCC"> very</font>

218
00:07:59,689 --> 00:08:04,759

219
00:08:01,699 --> 00:08:06,319
lot of slopping along and if you take a

look<font color="#CCCCCC"> at</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> where that person is going where</font>

it with relationships or career or

school there it's probably probably

<font color="#E5E5E5">plotting</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> along also sure yeah one of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

226
00:08:16,370 --> 00:08:20,420
core concepts here at the art of charm

227
00:08:18,170 --> 00:08:22,009
is how you do anything is how you do

228
00:08:20,420 --> 00:08:25,129
<font color="#CCCCCC">everything and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that has</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to do with the</font>

229
00:08:22,009 --> 00:08:27,170
crossover between the emotional<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

230
00:08:25,129 --> 00:08:29,209
mental and the physical as<font color="#CCCCCC"> well what I</font>

231
00:08:27,170 --> 00:08:30,800
do for a living<font color="#E5E5E5"> and what I also train</font>

232
00:08:29,209 --> 00:08:32,899
people to do at the art of charm

233
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:35,180
especially when like intelligence agents

234
00:08:32,899 --> 00:08:36,918
come in or Special Forces guys is how to

235
00:08:35,179 --> 00:08:39,069
read people and one of the things<font color="#CCCCCC"> that I</font>

236
00:08:36,918 --> 00:08:41,449
can show people how to look for is

237
00:08:39,070 --> 00:08:43,039
mental characteristics or emotional

238
00:08:41,450 --> 00:08:44,720
characteristics as a result of certain

239
00:08:43,038 --> 00:08:47,029
<font color="#E5E5E5">types of body language and you just</font>

240
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:49,040
touched on that issue as<font color="#CCCCCC"> well when you</font>

241
00:08:47,029 --> 00:08:51,169
see somebody slumped over or certain

00:08:49,039 --> 00:08:53,659
types<font color="#CCCCCC"> of eye contact weak eye contact</font>

243
00:08:51,169 --> 00:08:55,939
week posture even the way they hold

244
00:08:53,659 --> 00:08:58,189
their<font color="#E5E5E5"> feet you can really learn to read</font>

245
00:08:55,940 --> 00:08:59,510
what someone's emotional state is and

246
00:08:58,190 --> 00:09:01,280
what they think of<font color="#E5E5E5"> their own</font>

247
00:08:59,509 --> 00:09:03,350
capabilities and things like that as

248
00:09:01,279 --> 00:09:04,699
<font color="#CCCCCC">well and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you can also see when people</font>

249
00:09:03,350 --> 00:09:06,860
are suspicious when they're hiding

250
00:09:04,700 --> 00:09:08,030
things ask any cop right they look at

251
00:09:06,860 --> 00:09:11,180
<font color="#CCCCCC">somebody and they get that gut feeling</font>

252
00:09:08,029 --> 00:09:13,819
it's not<font color="#E5E5E5"> based on their sixth sense it's</font>

253
00:09:11,179 --> 00:09:15,559
based on nonverbal communication that

254
00:09:13,820 --> 00:09:18,140
they can't articulate but that they can

255
00:09:15,559 --> 00:09:20,179
see in process yeah people are doing

256
00:09:18,139 --> 00:09:21,919
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> all the time we're doing this when</font>

257
00:09:20,179 --> 00:09:23,479
it comes to dating two women are<font color="#E5E5E5"> very</font>

258
00:09:21,919 --> 00:09:25,129
good at it there about 10 to 20<font color="#CCCCCC"> times</font>

259
00:09:23,480 --> 00:09:27,710
better at it than men are<font color="#E5E5E5"> they just</font>

260
00:09:25,129 --> 00:09:29,870
don't know<font color="#CCCCCC"> it necessarily and so that's</font>

261
00:09:27,710 --> 00:09:32,780
why guys who have their proverbial shit

262
00:09:29,870 --> 00:09:34,429
together can do a lot better<font color="#E5E5E5"> with the</font>

263
00:09:32,779 --> 00:09:36,139
opposite sex especially if their

264
00:09:34,429 --> 00:09:37,789
physical component is there has nothing

265
00:09:36,139 --> 00:09:39,470
to do with how big their biceps are and

266
00:09:37,789 --> 00:09:42,079
has everything to do with<font color="#CCCCCC"> how they carry</font>

267
00:09:39,470 --> 00:09:43,460
themselves yeah absolutely the way you

268
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:45,650
carry<font color="#E5E5E5"> yourself will change the way you</font>

269
00:09:43,460 --> 00:09:47,030
think about<font color="#E5E5E5"> yourself yes the button</font>

270
00:09:45,649 --> 00:09:49,129
that's why when I say the body<font color="#E5E5E5"> is the</font>

271
00:09:47,029 --> 00:09:51,370
mind it's like you can change your<font color="#CCCCCC"> mind</font>

272
00:09:49,129 --> 00:09:53,870
by changing the way<font color="#CCCCCC"> you carry</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> yourself</font>

273
00:09:51,370 --> 00:09:55,429
<font color="#E5E5E5">their exercise components to allowing</font>

274
00:09:53,870 --> 00:09:57,620
that to happen stretching the right

00:09:55,429 --> 00:09:59,449
muscles breathing a particular way

276
00:09:57,620 --> 00:10:00,950
walking a particular way reducing

277
00:09:59,450 --> 00:10:02,990
muscular tension in certain

278
00:10:00,950 --> 00:10:04,759
<font color="#CCCCCC">those developing strength and certain</font>

279
00:10:02,990 --> 00:10:06,980
muscles that are flaccid in week that

280
00:10:04,759 --> 00:10:08,960
could potentially hold your posture up

281
00:10:06,980 --> 00:10:11,539
you see ya class it's never an

282
00:10:08,960 --> 00:10:13,400
attractive word right so<font color="#CCCCCC"> absolute that's</font>

283
00:10:11,539 --> 00:10:15,469
impotent those are two that<font color="#CCCCCC"> you don't</font>

284
00:10:13,399 --> 00:10:17,360
want to be<font color="#E5E5E5"> characterized at exactly</font>

285
00:10:15,470 --> 00:10:20,210
exactly it's funny you should say that

286
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:21,649
the mind is the<font color="#E5E5E5"> body because again a</font>

287
00:10:20,210 --> 00:10:23,720
principle of the art of trauma core

288
00:10:21,649 --> 00:10:25,279
principle is<font color="#E5E5E5"> that the body follows the</font>

289
00:10:23,720 --> 00:10:27,410
mind and the mind follows the body so

290
00:10:25,279 --> 00:10:29,539
exactly what you're talking<font color="#CCCCCC"> about before</font>

291

<font color="#E5E5E5">with mirroring your emotional state and</font>

292
00:10:29,539 --> 00:10:35,419
it is<font color="#CCCCCC"> very true i mean</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you've got</font>

293
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:36,740
<font color="#E5E5E5">certain types of body movements or sort</font>

294
00:10:35,419 --> 00:10:38,599
of physiology<font color="#E5E5E5"> that you can use to</font>

295
00:10:36,740 --> 00:10:41,360
<font color="#CCCCCC">improve mindset and of course we know</font>

296
00:10:38,600 --> 00:10:43,250
that mindset will improve physiology<font color="#E5E5E5"> or</font>

297
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:44,300
not improve physiology look at someone

298
00:10:43,250 --> 00:10:46,159
who's depressed or look at somebody

299
00:10:44,299 --> 00:10:47,719
who's in a great mood the way they carry

300
00:10:46,159 --> 00:10:48,889
themselves it's very apparent they don't

301
00:10:47,720 --> 00:10:49,850
have to come<font color="#CCCCCC"> up and tell you that</font>

302
00:10:48,889 --> 00:10:51,590
they're depressed and they certainly

303
00:10:49,850 --> 00:10:53,899
don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> have to come up and tell you that</font>

304
00:10:51,590 --> 00:10:55,610
they are excited about<font color="#E5E5E5"> life it has to do</font>

305
00:10:53,899 --> 00:10:57,590
with everything about<font color="#E5E5E5"> what they're doing</font>

306
00:10:55,610 --> 00:10:59,450
<font color="#CCCCCC">and you don't have to understand a word</font>

307
00:10:57,590 --> 00:11:01,910
of their language you<font color="#CCCCCC"> can tell if</font>

308
00:10:59,450 --> 00:11:04,400
somebody who speaks Mandarin Chinese is

309
00:11:01,909 --> 00:11:05,779
excited or sad by the way that they

310
00:11:04,399 --> 00:11:08,689
carry themselves you might have trouble

311
00:11:05,779 --> 00:11:10,309
discerning between angry especially with

312
00:11:08,690 --> 00:11:12,470
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> cantonese people but i digress</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> here</font>

313
00:11:10,309 --> 00:11:14,000
so your mission<font color="#CCCCCC"> is to become the</font>

314
00:11:12,470 --> 00:11:16,279
<font color="#E5E5E5">strongest version of yourself that's</font>

315
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:17,720
exactly in line<font color="#E5E5E5"> with what we do at the</font>

316
00:11:16,279 --> 00:11:19,189
art of charm which is one<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the reasons</font>

317
00:11:17,720 --> 00:11:21,110
why<font color="#E5E5E5"> i decided to have you come on and</font>

318
00:11:19,190 --> 00:11:23,390
<font color="#CCCCCC">you inspire others on the same journey</font>

319
00:11:21,110 --> 00:11:25,159
and so you and I are very<font color="#E5E5E5"> much in</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

320
00:11:23,389 --> 00:11:28,009
same role as mentors and role models for

321
00:11:25,159 --> 00:11:29,289
people whether we like it or not and I

322
00:11:28,009 --> 00:11:33,110
<font color="#E5E5E5">think this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is important</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> because</font>

323
00:11:29,289 --> 00:11:35,139
everybody as each individual raises his

324
00:11:33,110 --> 00:11:37,279
own level of consciousness as you say he

325
00:11:35,139 --> 00:11:39,649
<font color="#E5E5E5">automatically becomes a beacon of light</font>

326
00:11:37,279 --> 00:11:41,059
for others who may have<font color="#CCCCCC"> been lost or who</font>

327
00:11:39,649 --> 00:11:42,529
might not know the value of their

328
00:11:41,059 --> 00:11:44,629
existence what do you mean<font color="#CCCCCC"> by that I</font>

329
00:11:42,529 --> 00:11:48,529
mean essentially this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> the mentorship</font>

330
00:11:44,629 --> 00:11:51,350
role in itself well you said<font color="#CCCCCC"> it best</font>

331
00:11:48,529 --> 00:11:53,269
before when you said you bring whatever

332
00:11:51,350 --> 00:11:55,940
<font color="#E5E5E5">you are to everything</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that you do yes</font>

333
00:11:53,269 --> 00:11:57,710
got to work<font color="#E5E5E5"> with who you are because</font>

334
00:11:55,940 --> 00:12:01,490
<font color="#CCCCCC">it's far more important than what you do</font>

335
00:11:57,710 --> 00:12:03,440
I can be totally intelligent verbally

336
00:12:01,490 --> 00:12:05,570
and in the abstract about what is

337
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:08,500
<font color="#CCCCCC">required to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> get a particular type of</font>

338
00:12:05,570 --> 00:12:10,230
result for someone right I might be<font color="#E5E5E5"> very</font>

339
00:12:08,500 --> 00:12:12,179
<font color="#E5E5E5">well-read I might</font>

340
00:12:10,230 --> 00:12:14,159
have all the degrees next to my name<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

341
00:12:12,179 --> 00:12:15,929
might have taken all the courses

342
00:12:14,159 --> 00:12:18,360
necessary and in fact I happen to be

343
00:12:15,929 --> 00:12:21,259
very eloquent in my ability<font color="#CCCCCC"> to describe</font>

344
00:12:18,360 --> 00:12:24,539
everything that needs to<font color="#CCCCCC"> happen but</font>

345
00:12:21,259 --> 00:12:27,269
Ralph Waldo Emerson once said what<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

346
00:12:24,539 --> 00:12:30,779
are speaks so loud that I can't hear a

347
00:12:27,269 --> 00:12:34,919
word you're saying yes and and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I live</font>

348
00:12:30,779 --> 00:12:36,829
that I live that<font color="#E5E5E5"> because if I'm inviting</font>

349
00:12:34,919 --> 00:12:39,360
you to take action<font color="#CCCCCC"> in a particular area</font>

350
00:12:36,830 --> 00:12:41,420
in your life or to improve in a

351
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:44,129
particular way because<font color="#CCCCCC"> I want</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to see you</font>

352
00:12:41,419 --> 00:12:45,449
become self actualized I want you to be

353
00:12:44,129 --> 00:12:47,070
<font color="#E5E5E5">the strongest version yourself that's</font>

354
00:12:45,450 --> 00:12:50,640
why I'm a coach I get a kick<font color="#E5E5E5"> out of</font>

355
00:12:47,070 --> 00:12:55,080
watching people succeed i<font color="#E5E5E5"> myself need to</font>

356
00:12:50,639 --> 00:12:57,480
embody that first yeah<font color="#E5E5E5"> I agree a hundred</font>

357
00:12:55,080 --> 00:12:59,280
percent if<font color="#CCCCCC"> you don't embody it really</font>

358
00:12:57,480 --> 00:13:01,050
it's about leading by example in a lot

359
00:12:59,279 --> 00:13:02,909
<font color="#E5E5E5">of ways the difference here is that</font>

360
00:13:01,049 --> 00:13:04,589
we're leading all of those around us

361
00:13:02,909 --> 00:13:06,659
whether or not we choose<font color="#CCCCCC"> to or not and</font>

362
00:13:04,590 --> 00:13:08,670
you'd mentioning I think this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is amazing</font>

363
00:13:06,659 --> 00:13:11,159
<font color="#E5E5E5">the most unselfish thing that we can do</font>

364
00:13:08,669 --> 00:13:13,679
is to become a stronger version of

365
00:13:11,159 --> 00:13:15,600
ourselves because since we are always

366
00:13:13,679 --> 00:13:17,819
leading by example again whether we

367
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:20,399
choose<font color="#E5E5E5"> to or not we're either leading</font>

368
00:13:17,820 --> 00:13:21,629
<font color="#E5E5E5">people upwards or downwards so if we</font>

369
00:13:20,399 --> 00:13:23,689
become the<font color="#E5E5E5"> strongest version of</font>

370
00:13:21,629 --> 00:13:26,159
ourselves we inspire others to do that

371
00:13:23,690 --> 00:13:27,420
absolutely that sort of<font color="#E5E5E5"> begs a question</font>

372
00:13:26,159 --> 00:13:29,159
what does it mean to become the

373
00:13:27,419 --> 00:13:31,500
<font color="#E5E5E5">strongest version of yourself what do</font>

374
00:13:29,159 --> 00:13:34,649
<font color="#E5E5E5">you think about that I really believe is</font>

375
00:13:31,500 --> 00:13:36,929
a totally subjective experience and the

376
00:13:34,649 --> 00:13:39,600
first place to begin is with the simple

377
00:13:36,929 --> 00:13:43,259
question how's<font color="#CCCCCC"> that working out for</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

378
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:45,810
Yeah Yeah right because I can make all

379
00:13:43,259 --> 00:13:48,269
my moral judgments that I could have<font color="#CCCCCC"> all</font>

380
00:13:45,809 --> 00:13:51,179
my ideals lined up about what it should

381
00:13:48,269 --> 00:13:53,100
look like for you but we're also unique

382
00:13:51,179 --> 00:13:56,729
in our own individual ways and our

383
00:13:53,100 --> 00:13:59,399
experiences our DNA all contribute to

384
00:13:56,730 --> 00:14:01,950
who we are and for<font color="#E5E5E5"> me to stand here and</font>

385
00:13:59,399 --> 00:14:05,399
<font color="#E5E5E5">say mine is the one</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and only way and all</font>

386
00:14:01,950 --> 00:14:07,200
other ways are<font color="#E5E5E5"> doomed to failure doesn't</font>

387
00:14:05,399 --> 00:14:08,759
respect the human being in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> way that</font>

388
00:14:07,200 --> 00:14:11,610
a human being should be respected and my

389
00:14:08,759 --> 00:14:13,679
main sentiment to proceed from is with a

390
00:14:11,610 --> 00:14:16,889
deep and profound level of respect for

391
00:14:13,679 --> 00:14:20,069
the other<font color="#E5E5E5"> human being the only thing I</font>

392
00:14:16,889 --> 00:14:22,049
ask is that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we all be as objective as we</font>

393
00:14:20,070 --> 00:14:23,310
possibly can and honest with ourselves

394
00:14:22,049 --> 00:14:27,209
be real

395
00:14:23,309 --> 00:14:29,039
when the<font color="#E5E5E5"> question is posed how is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

396
00:14:27,210 --> 00:14:31,680
working out for you not what do you

397
00:14:29,039 --> 00:14:34,110
think about these ideas and these morals

398
00:14:31,679 --> 00:14:35,909
and these judgments and so on and<font color="#E5E5E5"> so</font>

399
00:14:34,110 --> 00:14:38,759
forth and who told<font color="#E5E5E5"> you and what book</font>

400
00:14:35,909 --> 00:14:40,169
says how's<font color="#CCCCCC"> that working out for you for</font>

401
00:14:38,759 --> 00:14:42,569
example I had a<font color="#E5E5E5"> conversation with a guy</font>

402
00:14:40,169 --> 00:14:44,699
<font color="#CCCCCC">just a few moments ago and we're talking</font>

403
00:14:42,570 --> 00:14:46,528
about<font color="#E5E5E5"> the idea</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of vegetarianism now I</font>

404
00:14:44,700 --> 00:14:49,170
<font color="#E5E5E5">have nothing against being a vegetarian</font>

405
00:14:46,528 --> 00:14:50,789
absolutely not fact it seems as if of

406
00:14:49,169 --> 00:14:52,409
course<font color="#CCCCCC"> there are cultures that are</font>

407
00:14:50,789 --> 00:14:54,360
vegetarian cultures and they<font color="#E5E5E5"> happen to</font>

408
00:14:52,409 --> 00:14:55,829
be very healthy<font color="#E5E5E5"> and intelligent that</font>

409
00:14:54,360 --> 00:14:57,180
<font color="#E5E5E5">particular way but then you've got</font>

410
00:14:55,830 --> 00:14:58,710
people who<font color="#E5E5E5"> have adopted this idea</font>

411
00:14:57,179 --> 00:15:01,349
vegetarianism because the book they read

412
00:14:58,710 --> 00:15:03,750
or an experience that they had and it

413
00:15:01,350 --> 00:15:05,430
clearly is not working out for<font color="#CCCCCC"> them you</font>

414
00:15:03,750 --> 00:15:07,559
just look<font color="#E5E5E5"> at your gray skin and they're</font>

415
00:15:05,429 --> 00:15:10,439
bloodshot eyes and yellow teeth<font color="#CCCCCC"> and hair</font>

416
00:15:07,559 --> 00:15:12,419
falling out<font color="#E5E5E5"> the weak frail disposition</font>

417
00:15:10,440 --> 00:15:14,190
that they carry themselves with and they

418
00:15:12,419 --> 00:15:16,909
can explain all the reasons why

419
00:15:14,190 --> 00:15:19,470
vegetarianism is right they<font color="#E5E5E5"> can be very</font>

420
00:15:16,909 --> 00:15:22,439
adamant and convincing about

421
00:15:19,470 --> 00:15:24,420
<font color="#E5E5E5">vegetarianism but one glance at the</font>

422
00:15:22,440 --> 00:15:27,260
<font color="#E5E5E5">individual and it's clear that shit</font>

423
00:15:24,419 --> 00:15:29,370
ain't working out for you yeah exactly

424
00:15:27,259 --> 00:15:31,169
hey guys I<font color="#E5E5E5"> want to take a quick</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> break</font>

425

for a second here you've<font color="#E5E5E5"> heard me talk a</font>

sits around and thinks about<font color="#E5E5E5"> becoming</font>

441
00:16:00,419 --> 00:16:04,469

00:16:02,580 --> 00:16:06,330
that today is<font color="#CCCCCC"> the day that is going to</font>

463
00:16:43,950 --> 00:16:48,120
cuz I've got this going for me and I've

00:16:46,019 --> 00:16:49,889
got that<font color="#E5E5E5"> going for me and like I don't</font>

00:16:51,870 --> 00:16:56,730
<font color="#E5E5E5">six-pack you know I just ran a half</font>

468
00:16:54,029 --> 00:16:58,620
marathon you know I'm doing<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay and</font>

469
00:16:56,730 --> 00:17:01,110
then you're thinking that's weird

470
00:16:58,620 --> 00:17:03,149
<font color="#E5E5E5">because he just wrote in saying how all</font>

471
00:17:01,110 --> 00:17:04,890
this stuff is<font color="#CCCCCC"> so inspiring and how all</font>

472
00:17:03,149 --> 00:17:06,000
this stuff is<font color="#CCCCCC"> so life-changing but then</font>

473
00:17:04,890 --> 00:17:08,730
when I asked him to put his money where

474
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:10,230
his mouth is it's not quite happening

475
00:17:08,730 --> 00:17:12,328
where's the disconnect and that's when I

476
00:17:10,230 --> 00:17:13,920
bust out that question<font color="#CCCCCC"> alright well</font>

477
00:17:12,328 --> 00:17:15,750
how's that working out for you<font color="#E5E5E5"> and then</font>

478
00:17:13,920 --> 00:17:16,920
usually if<font color="#CCCCCC"> you get that and you know</font>

479
00:17:15,750 --> 00:17:20,068
what i'm talking about Elliot when you

480
00:17:16,920 --> 00:17:22,800
get that honest answer they're like well

481
00:17:20,068 --> 00:17:25,529
it's not really where I want it to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be</font>

482
00:17:22,799 --> 00:17:27,838
<font color="#E5E5E5">right now and I ran a marathon last year</font>

483
00:17:25,529 --> 00:17:29,129
and I'm in worse shape and this isn't

484
00:17:27,838 --> 00:17:31,470
working I got some blood work back

485
00:17:29,130 --> 00:17:33,840
that's not so positive and I got an

486
00:17:31,470 --> 00:17:35,850
injury that I caused and I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> doing this</font>

487
00:17:33,839 --> 00:17:37,379
and and then you get<font color="#E5E5E5"> to the bottom</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

488
00:17:35,849 --> 00:17:38,939
things when people are really honest

489
00:17:37,380 --> 00:17:41,790
with<font color="#E5E5E5"> themselves or honest with you about</font>

490
00:17:38,940 --> 00:17:43,920
how's that working out right you know I

491
00:17:41,789 --> 00:17:45,839
use that term becoming the stronger

492
00:17:43,920 --> 00:17:49,080
version of yourself with an emphasis on

493
00:17:45,839 --> 00:17:50,759
becoming but i also want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to shed light</font>

494
00:17:49,079 --> 00:17:54,000
on<font color="#E5E5E5"> the fact that there is no final</font>

495
00:17:50,759 --> 00:17:56,099
destination except death and a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

496
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:58,349
<font color="#E5E5E5">people of course we want to be right you</font>

497
00:17:56,099 --> 00:18:00,629
<font color="#E5E5E5">know we sort of the way our education</font>

498
00:17:58,349 --> 00:18:02,599
system is conditioned us is you want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

499
00:18:00,630 --> 00:18:05,850
be right and you want to avoid any

500
00:18:02,599 --> 00:18:09,149
experience that might lend to failure at

501
00:18:05,849 --> 00:18:11,279
all but life is not<font color="#E5E5E5"> that black and white</font>

502
00:18:09,150 --> 00:18:14,100
<font color="#CCCCCC">and back like from my short experience</font>

503
00:18:11,279 --> 00:18:17,819
here on earth and the wisdom gathered

504
00:18:14,099 --> 00:18:20,490
through many generations life is a

505
00:18:17,819 --> 00:18:23,609
<font color="#CCCCCC">journey it's a dance it's something</font>

506
00:18:20,490 --> 00:18:25,740
<font color="#E5E5E5">we're doing and it would</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> be in our best</font>

507
00:18:23,609 --> 00:18:28,199
interest in my opinion<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be objective</font>

508
00:18:25,740 --> 00:18:30,870
<font color="#CCCCCC">about where we are what we've got how we</font>

509
00:18:28,200 --> 00:18:33,059
got here choosing where we'd like to be

510
00:18:30,869 --> 00:18:35,849
what type of experiences we'd like to

511
00:18:33,059 --> 00:18:39,210
have and proceeding in that direction

512
00:18:35,849 --> 00:18:40,919
with full awareness that perhaps i'm

513
00:18:39,210 --> 00:18:44,009
going to stumble<font color="#E5E5E5"> i might scrape my knee</font>

514
00:18:40,920 --> 00:18:46,259
it might not<font color="#CCCCCC"> work out but be willing to</font>

515
00:18:44,009 --> 00:18:48,930
get up and try again without being so

516
00:18:46,259 --> 00:18:50,250
dogmatic and emotionally attached<font color="#E5E5E5"> to the</font>

517
00:18:48,930 --> 00:18:51,420
particular ideals

518
00:18:50,250 --> 00:18:53,099
associated with the journey or the

519
00:18:51,420 --> 00:18:55,170
length of the journey that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I started on</font>

520
00:18:53,099 --> 00:18:58,019
to say okay well time to put<font color="#CCCCCC"> that away</font>

521
00:18:55,170 --> 00:18:59,400
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> try something else sure yeah now it</font>

522
00:18:58,019 --> 00:19:00,930
makes a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of sense and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that sort of</font>

523
00:18:59,400 --> 00:19:02,670
leads to my follow up here which was

524
00:19:00,930 --> 00:19:05,009
what everyone's thinking well great<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay</font>

you a very<font color="#E5E5E5"> broad answer that might not</font>

533
00:19:20,039 --> 00:19:25,889
seem like it makes much sense but bear

534
00:19:21,900 --> 00:19:27,180
with me meditation when I say meditation

535
00:19:25,890 --> 00:19:29,400
I don't necessarily<font color="#CCCCCC"> mean there's any</font>

536
00:19:27,180 --> 00:19:30,630
fixed form of meditation that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you need</font>

537
00:19:29,400 --> 00:19:32,130
to engage and I'm not saying you've

538
00:19:30,630 --> 00:19:33,900
gotta sit cross-legged about saying you

539
00:19:32,130 --> 00:19:35,910
have to<font color="#E5E5E5"> do yoga but say you have to do</font>

540
00:19:33,900 --> 00:19:37,590
anything that looks anything like what

541
00:19:35,910 --> 00:19:40,650
you've been told meditation is<font color="#E5E5E5"> when i</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">use enter meditation I mean getting out</font>

543
00:19:40,650 --> 00:19:44,400
of<font color="#CCCCCC"> your own way really that's what it is</font>

544
00:19:42,900 --> 00:19:46,620
shutting off the part of you that

545
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:48,210
happens to always get in the way<font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

546
00:19:46,619 --> 00:19:50,189
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> part of you that happens to always</font>

547
00:19:48,210 --> 00:19:53,220
get in the way has been labeled many

548
00:19:50,190 --> 00:19:55,529
things including our ego and our ego is

549
00:19:53,220 --> 00:19:58,200
is part of us that has been<font color="#CCCCCC"> colored by</font>

550
00:19:55,529 --> 00:19:59,910
our experiences by our conditioning by

551
00:19:58,200 --> 00:20:02,850
what other people have told us we are

552
00:19:59,910 --> 00:20:05,279
other people told us we should do so on

553
00:20:02,849 --> 00:20:07,649
and so forth it's the collective baggage

554
00:20:05,279 --> 00:20:10,139
that has been laid upon us throughout

555
00:20:07,650 --> 00:20:11,970
our lives probably since conception

556
00:20:10,140 --> 00:20:15,240
there are people that look at it that

557
00:20:11,970 --> 00:20:18,079
way sure but there's a time<font color="#E5E5E5"> and there's</font>

558
00:20:15,240 --> 00:20:22,049
an opportunity available to all of<font color="#E5E5E5"> us to</font>

559
00:20:18,079 --> 00:20:23,490
turn that off for<font color="#E5E5E5"> a moment and get in</font>

560
00:20:22,049 --> 00:20:25,799
touch with another part<font color="#E5E5E5"> of our</font>

561
00:20:23,490 --> 00:20:27,299
intelligence and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I happen to believe</font>

562
00:20:25,799 --> 00:20:29,819
that this intelligence is found in<font color="#E5E5E5"> our</font>

563
00:20:27,299 --> 00:20:31,799
bodies<font color="#E5E5E5"> and when someone says listen to</font>

564
00:20:29,819 --> 00:20:33,689
your heart I don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> think it's purely</font>

565
00:20:31,799 --> 00:20:37,079
metaphorical I don't think it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> just a</font>

00:20:33,690 --> 00:20:39,059
metaphor to<font color="#E5E5E5"> say this guy's got guts or</font>

567
00:20:37,079 --> 00:20:41,480
trust your gut or listen to your heart

568
00:20:39,059 --> 00:20:44,849
what I truly believe is if we shut off

569
00:20:41,480 --> 00:20:48,380
just ignore for a moment or temper the

570
00:20:44,849 --> 00:20:51,149
chatter happening in our head brain and

571
00:20:48,380 --> 00:20:53,100
consult with our hearts<font color="#E5E5E5"> consult with our</font>

572
00:20:51,150 --> 00:20:56,490
guts develop the courage and the passion

associated with each then the<font color="#CCCCCC"> answer for</font>

574
00:20:56,490 --> 00:21:01,349
what the strongest version of ourselves

575
00:20:58,679 --> 00:21:03,030
or the journey towards the strongest

576
00:21:01,349 --> 00:21:03,599
version of ourselves will look like<font color="#E5E5E5"> will</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">be</font>

578
00:21:03,599 --> 00:21:09,029
revealed excellent so it's all about

579
00:21:06,210 --> 00:21:11,069
essentially to sound so cliche by

580
00:21:09,029 --> 00:21:12,690
accident and just totally unavoidably

581
00:21:11,069 --> 00:21:14,879
it's all<font color="#E5E5E5"> about</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> getting in touch with</font>

582
00:21:12,690 --> 00:21:16,440
yourself but a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of that has to do</font>

583
00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:18,630
with shutting off the noise from<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

584
00:21:16,440 --> 00:21:20,308
outside through say meditation and

585
00:21:18,630 --> 00:21:22,289
getting out<font color="#E5E5E5"> of your own ways that what</font>

586
00:21:20,308 --> 00:21:24,329
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> mean by</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that absolutely one hundred</font>

587
00:21:22,288 --> 00:21:25,650
percent good sometimes<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's hard to dig</font>

588
00:21:24,329 --> 00:21:27,629
through this stuff<font color="#E5E5E5"> because a lot of guys</font>

589
00:21:25,650 --> 00:21:29,730
listen<font color="#CCCCCC"> to you and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I love what you say</font>

590
00:21:27,630 --> 00:21:32,400
that's why you're on the show but<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

591
00:21:29,730 --> 00:21:34,410
think a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of guys listen and go dude I</font>

592
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:36,538
have<font color="#CCCCCC"> no idea what you're talking about</font>

593
00:21:34,410 --> 00:21:38,669
it sounds great but what do you<font color="#E5E5E5"> even</font>

594
00:21:36,538 --> 00:21:40,140
mean and so it's important to sort of

595
00:21:38,669 --> 00:21:42,120
cut through some<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the chaff because</font>

596
00:21:40,140 --> 00:21:44,220
it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> really easy</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> for</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you guys like you</font>

597
00:21:42,119 --> 00:21:46,529
and I to get<font color="#E5E5E5"> lost in years</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of study and</font>

598
00:21:44,220 --> 00:21:49,079
realize oh there's somebody listening

599
00:21:46,529 --> 00:21:51,839
out there that's brand new right and is

600
00:21:49,079 --> 00:21:53,849
<font color="#E5E5E5">going huh I think that one of the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> best</font>

601
00:21:51,839 --> 00:21:56,668
<font color="#CCCCCC">ways to describe meditation is getting</font>

602
00:21:53,849 --> 00:21:58,469
out of<font color="#CCCCCC"> your own way fortunately any guy</font>

603
00:21:56,669 --> 00:22:01,320
who SAT<font color="#CCCCCC"> there and tried to maintain</font>

604
00:21:58,470 --> 00:22:03,329
silence of thought 45 minutes knows

605
00:22:01,319 --> 00:22:05,099
exactly what we're talking about<font color="#E5E5E5"> you sit</font>

606
00:22:03,329 --> 00:22:06,259
down<font color="#E5E5E5"> to go I'm just gonna focus on my</font>

607
00:22:05,099 --> 00:22:08,879
breathing and then suddenly<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're like</font>

608
00:22:06,259 --> 00:22:11,069
why are pencils yellow whose idea was

609
00:22:08,880 --> 00:22:14,220
that do I<font color="#E5E5E5"> consider myself more of a</font>

610
00:22:11,069 --> 00:22:16,319
baller or a shot caller I wait a minute

611
00:22:14,220 --> 00:22:19,470
oh crap<font color="#E5E5E5"> no no thoughts no thoughts right</font>

612
00:22:16,319 --> 00:22:21,839
it's really hard um we're always doing

613
00:22:19,470 --> 00:22:23,819
that and you just<font color="#E5E5E5"> happen to notice that</font>

614
00:22:21,839 --> 00:22:25,470
layer of thought when<font color="#E5E5E5"> you try to turn</font>

615
00:22:23,819 --> 00:22:27,509
off the conscious layer of thought that

616
00:22:25,470 --> 00:22:29,940
<font color="#CCCCCC">means there's probably like a hundred</font>

617
00:22:27,509 --> 00:22:31,798
layers or more of thought<font color="#CCCCCC"> that are</font>

618
00:22:29,940 --> 00:22:33,029
<font color="#E5E5E5">getting in our way and we're just</font>

619
00:22:31,798 --> 00:22:34,619
letting it happen because we've been

620
00:22:33,029 --> 00:22:36,960
<font color="#E5E5E5">letting it happen our whole life but</font>

621
00:22:34,619 --> 00:22:39,119
once you dig through some of that we can

622
00:22:36,960 --> 00:22:41,190
see what our bodies / heart truly wants

623
00:22:39,119 --> 00:22:44,250
and then we can get that path that you

624
00:22:41,190 --> 00:22:46,558
speak of right oh absolutely that's been

625
00:22:44,250 --> 00:22:48,808
my experience it's not because I've read

626
00:22:46,558 --> 00:22:52,589
<font color="#E5E5E5">a lot about it because I happen to like</font>

627
00:22:48,808 --> 00:22:54,418
<font color="#CCCCCC">the ideas I just happen to have use</font>

628
00:22:52,589 --> 00:22:55,918
these tools I've been lucky enough to

629
00:22:54,419 --> 00:22:58,710
have people to share them with me<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

630
00:22:55,919 --> 00:23:00,299
I've grown for lack of better terms

631
00:22:58,710 --> 00:23:03,870
addicted<font color="#E5E5E5"> to them because without</font>

632
00:23:00,298 --> 00:23:06,240
meditation without exercise without deep

633
00:23:03,869 --> 00:23:08,819
breathing it just<font color="#E5E5E5"> doesn't work for</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> me</font>

634
00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:11,700
life doesn't go as smoothly as it should

635
00:23:08,819 --> 00:23:14,099
when I give up or take a break<font color="#E5E5E5"> from</font>

636
00:23:11,700 --> 00:23:16,380
those practices so what about some of

637
00:23:14,099 --> 00:23:17,199
the challenges that do impede us on the

638
00:23:16,380 --> 00:23:19,179
journey I mean

639
00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:22,960
you don't have time you<font color="#CCCCCC"> don't know how</font>

640
00:23:19,179 --> 00:23:24,730
<font color="#E5E5E5">to do it we run out of ideas on how to</font>

641
00:23:22,960 --> 00:23:26,048
do it<font color="#E5E5E5"> I mean there's a lot that gets</font>

642
00:23:24,730 --> 00:23:28,538
thrown in<font color="#E5E5E5"> our way what</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> are some common</font>

643
00:23:26,048 --> 00:23:30,460
challenges that you find guys walking

644
00:23:28,538 --> 00:23:32,408
through your doors have I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think the</font>

645
00:23:30,460 --> 00:23:33,819
<font color="#E5E5E5">biggest challenge is no of course I say</font>

646
00:23:32,409 --> 00:23:36,100
getting<font color="#E5E5E5"> in your own way but what does</font>

647
00:23:33,819 --> 00:23:39,879
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> exactly look like right number one</font>

648
00:23:36,099 --> 00:23:41,829
is everybody waits until the stars are

649
00:23:39,880 --> 00:23:43,990
aligned before they take action now when

650
00:23:41,829 --> 00:23:46,119
I say that metaphorically<font color="#E5E5E5"> of course but</font>

651
00:23:43,990 --> 00:23:48,849
we want all the information with all the

652
00:23:46,119 --> 00:23:50,619
<font color="#CCCCCC">ideas we want all the know-how before we</font>

653
00:23:48,849 --> 00:23:52,658
get<font color="#E5E5E5"> started with something we want the</font>

654
00:23:50,619 --> 00:23:55,599
blueprint we want it all laid out we

655
00:23:52,659 --> 00:23:58,870
want<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> perfect plan for action before</font>

656
00:23:55,599 --> 00:24:00,668
we do anything and we<font color="#E5E5E5"> want security we</font>

657
00:23:58,869 --> 00:24:02,319
want safety and that's really what the

658
00:24:00,669 --> 00:24:04,600
figment of our imagination that

659
00:24:02,319 --> 00:24:07,269
stimulated when we have the plan laid

660
00:24:04,599 --> 00:24:10,449
out the foolproof plan is providing for

661
00:24:07,269 --> 00:24:12,730
us or giving us the illusion of another

662
00:24:10,450 --> 00:24:15,278
<font color="#E5E5E5">Emerson quote because i love</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> emerson so</font>

663
00:24:12,730 --> 00:24:18,149
damn much<font color="#CCCCCC"> alright his words have just</font>

664
00:24:15,278 --> 00:24:21,909
been so instrumental in my life is this

665
00:24:18,148 --> 00:24:24,278
do the thing and you will have the power

666
00:24:21,909 --> 00:24:26,230
<font color="#CCCCCC">and that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> basically means don't wait</font>

667
00:24:24,278 --> 00:24:28,419
until you seemingly have the power

668
00:24:26,230 --> 00:24:31,808
because<font color="#E5E5E5"> no power is granted you without</font>

669
00:24:28,419 --> 00:24:34,720
experience go and do the thing you're

670
00:24:31,808 --> 00:24:36,278
afraid<font color="#CCCCCC"> to do go and do that thing wait a</font>

671
00:24:34,720 --> 00:24:38,500
second but I don't know doesn't matter

672
00:24:36,278 --> 00:24:40,839
but wait what about this<font color="#E5E5E5"> so on and so</font>

673
00:24:38,500 --> 00:24:44,079
forth at it really<font color="#E5E5E5"> matter go do it put</font>

674
00:24:40,839 --> 00:24:46,750
one foot on the journey first and then

675
00:24:44,079 --> 00:24:48,548
begin to<font color="#E5E5E5"> feel your way down that road</font>

676
00:24:46,750 --> 00:24:51,009
and that requires<font color="#CCCCCC"> like we discussed</font>

677
00:24:48,548 --> 00:24:53,859
earlier<font color="#E5E5E5"> being in touch with yourself I</font>

678
00:24:51,009 --> 00:24:56,079
think<font color="#E5E5E5"> that any goal that we set for</font>

679
00:24:53,859 --> 00:24:59,048
ourselves any journey that we decide to

680
00:24:56,079 --> 00:25:00,490
<font color="#E5E5E5">go</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> on is far less about what we attain</font>

681
00:24:59,048 --> 00:25:02,798
its follow us about the achieving the

682
00:25:00,490 --> 00:25:05,349
goals follow us about getting to<font color="#E5E5E5"> the end</font>

683
00:25:02,798 --> 00:25:08,288
of the journey and more<font color="#E5E5E5"> about who we</font>

684
00:25:05,349 --> 00:25:11,019
become as we're moving<font color="#CCCCCC"> along that path</font>

685
00:25:08,288 --> 00:25:12,460
<font color="#E5E5E5">and the reason</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> why that happens is</font>

686
00:25:11,019 --> 00:25:14,679
because we've<font color="#E5E5E5"> got to be very</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> sensitive</font>

687
00:25:12,460 --> 00:25:15,970
about who we are<font color="#CCCCCC"> and where we're</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> going</font>

688
00:25:14,679 --> 00:25:18,490
and the choices we<font color="#CCCCCC"> make and</font>

689
00:25:15,970 --> 00:25:20,169
self-reflection and objectivity it

690
00:25:18,490 --> 00:25:22,720
brings<font color="#E5E5E5"> up an excellent point because a</font>

00:25:20,169 --> 00:25:24,970
lot of people<font color="#E5E5E5"> do this they don't start</font>

and not the spoils that's the true gift

717
00:26:11,950 --> 00:26:15,700
the true gift of the lessons you learn

718
00:26:13,839 --> 00:26:18,519
along the way and<font color="#CCCCCC"> the character that you</font>

719

develop as you navigate the path and we

720
00:26:18,519 --> 00:26:22,000
<font color="#CCCCCC">mentioned before a little bit about</font>

721
00:26:19,779 --> 00:26:23,859
breathing and one of the<font color="#CCCCCC"> things that we</font>

722
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:24,880
both share that this is actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> one of</font>

723
00:26:23,859 --> 00:26:27,219
the comments that got my attention

724
00:26:24,880 --> 00:26:28,990
<font color="#E5E5E5">because we say the same thing when we</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">breathing into your balls you say the</font>

guys don't really understand what it

732
00:26:38,349 --> 00:26:41,139
means to breathe deeply they don't

<font color="#E5E5E5">really understand what it means to</font>

734
00:26:41,140 --> 00:26:46,450
breathe from your balls that idea was

735
00:26:43,480 --> 00:26:50,140
first shared with me through<font color="#E5E5E5"> alexander</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">Lowen who was a student of Wilhelm Reich</font>

737
00:26:50,140 --> 00:26:53,830
Wilhelm Reich was a student of Sigmund

738
00:26:52,029 --> 00:26:55,329
Freud and Wilhelm Reich was an

739
00:26:53,829 --> 00:26:58,000
interesting dude<font color="#E5E5E5"> because as a student of</font>

740
00:26:55,329 --> 00:27:01,000
Freud's he studied psychoanalysis of

741
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:04,329
course and he was a psychoanalyst and he

742
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:06,640
began work by having his client lay on a

743
00:27:04,329 --> 00:27:08,769

744
00:27:06,640 --> 00:27:11,080
how psychoanalysis began and that's how

745
00:27:08,769 --> 00:27:13,869
many do it still today what this

746
00:27:11,079 --> 00:27:15,460
interesting guy Wilhelm Reich who if you

747
00:27:13,869 --> 00:27:16,839
google him you'll see all<font color="#E5E5E5"> types of weird</font>

748
00:27:15,460 --> 00:27:18,759
and interesting things about him he's

749
00:27:16,839 --> 00:27:20,049
kind<font color="#CCCCCC"> of a crazy dude one of the crazy</font>

751
00:27:20,049 --> 00:27:25,240
embraced is that you learn far more

00:27:22,359 --> 00:27:28,269
about<font color="#E5E5E5"> the psychological ills and pains</font>

that your patient<font color="#E5E5E5"> pass by watching him</font>

00:27:28,269 --> 00:27:33,460
breathe than listening<font color="#CCCCCC"> to him talk and</font>

755
00:27:30,730 --> 00:27:35,680
<font color="#E5E5E5">that sort of points back</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to the original</font>

756
00:27:33,460 --> 00:27:38,200
idea that you are what you are speaks so

757
00:27:35,680 --> 00:27:41,380
loudly I can't hear a word you say we

758
00:27:38,200 --> 00:27:43,150
become so good at posturing that the

759
00:27:41,380 --> 00:27:44,080
division of an individual can be clouded

760
00:27:43,150 --> 00:27:46,298
by the amount<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

761
00:27:44,079 --> 00:27:48,639
words or the eloquence and their<font color="#E5E5E5"> ability</font>

762
00:27:46,298 --> 00:27:50,168
to to speak we've convinced ourselves

763
00:27:48,640 --> 00:27:52,269
and tricked ourselves to such a degree

764
00:27:50,169 --> 00:27:54,519
that we can get<font color="#E5E5E5"> other people to drink</font>

765
00:27:52,269 --> 00:27:56,440
our kool-aid as well but what Reich was

766
00:27:54,519 --> 00:27:58,720
saying is I'm not interested<font color="#E5E5E5"> in</font>

767
00:27:56,440 --> 00:28:01,419
listening<font color="#E5E5E5"> to my patients speak in fact</font>

just being very enrolled in watching

what he called the respiratory wave of

<font color="#CCCCCC">integris you know you everything lined</font>

822
00:30:16,839 --> 00:30:22,949
up perfectly properly you breathe so

823
00:30:19,660 --> 00:30:25,060
deeply and softly that your pelvic floor

824
00:30:22,950 --> 00:30:28,140
expands there's a really interesting

825
00:30:25,059 --> 00:30:31,119
book called embryonic breathing and

826
00:30:28,140 --> 00:30:32,170
Qigong meditation and in that book<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

827
00:30:31,119 --> 00:30:33,339
think that's one of the reasons why I

828
00:30:32,170 --> 00:30:36,759
started<font color="#E5E5E5"> saying breathe into your balls</font>

829
00:30:33,339 --> 00:30:37,990
the technique was to begin breathing so

830
00:30:36,759 --> 00:30:42,099
<font color="#CCCCCC">much that you could actually feel your</font>

831
00:30:37,990 --> 00:30:43,329
balls drop with your inhalation and the

832
00:30:42,099 --> 00:30:45,519
<font color="#E5E5E5">reason why your balls are drop is</font>

833
00:30:43,329 --> 00:30:47,649
because you're so soft in your torso

834
00:30:45,519 --> 00:30:51,519
that when your diaphragm expands when it

835
00:30:47,650 --> 00:30:53,620
drops it pushes your stomach your<font color="#CCCCCC"> colon</font>

836
00:30:51,519 --> 00:30:55,750
all your organs down into your pelvic

837
00:30:53,619 --> 00:30:59,649
floor and your pelvic<font color="#CCCCCC"> floor is so soft</font>

838
00:30:55,750 --> 00:31:02,440
that it allows those organs to sort of

839
00:30:59,650 --> 00:31:05,230
push down on the perineum down into your

840
00:31:02,440 --> 00:31:08,130
pelvic floor that<font color="#CCCCCC"> is a person who is</font>

841
00:31:05,230 --> 00:31:11,920
soft from the tip of their head<font color="#CCCCCC"> to their</font>

842
00:31:08,130 --> 00:31:14,860
tailbone and when they breathe they're

843
00:31:11,920 --> 00:31:17,289
really accessing all of what's available

844
00:31:14,859 --> 00:31:19,240
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> us on multiple different levels</font>

845
00:31:17,289 --> 00:31:22,960

874
00:32:16,410 --> 00:32:20,310
to destroy the muscular tension that

875
00:32:18,119 --> 00:32:22,500
blocks that type of breathing I mean

876
00:32:20,309 --> 00:32:24,089
you've<font color="#CCCCCC"> got some bioenergetics</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I don't</font>

00:32:22,500 --> 00:32:25,910
<font color="#CCCCCC">even know what that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> necessarily is but</font>

878
00:32:24,089 --> 00:32:28,169
there's got to be some stretching some

879
00:32:25,910 --> 00:32:31,200
exercises that guys can do because<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

880
00:32:28,170 --> 00:32:32,730
know that it's not just as easy<font color="#E5E5E5"> as crack</font>

881
00:32:31,200 --> 00:32:36,600
in the back and getting to work<font color="#E5E5E5"> on that</font>

882
00:32:32,730 --> 00:32:42,110
stuff no and I tell you in my<font color="#CCCCCC"> experience</font>

883
00:32:36,599 --> 00:32:45,119
it's an ongoing never-ending process of

884
00:32:42,109 --> 00:32:49,019
adjusting to civilization adjusting to

885
00:32:45,119 --> 00:32:50,939
life by using deep breathing stretching

886
00:32:49,019 --> 00:32:52,470
exercising I there's one that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I would</font>

887
00:32:50,940 --> 00:32:55,740
like<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> share</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> with you one exercise in</font>

888
00:32:52,470 --> 00:32:58,019
particular it's called<font color="#E5E5E5"> a bow and it</font>

889
00:32:55,740 --> 00:32:59,849
essentially requires that you stand on

890
00:32:58,019 --> 00:33:02,069
<font color="#CCCCCC">your two feet there are several</font>

891
00:32:59,849 --> 00:33:03,899
variations<font color="#E5E5E5"> of them but</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> one which is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> like</font>

892
00:33:02,069 --> 00:33:06,359
<font color="#CCCCCC">the most aggressive is to raise your</font>

00:33:03,900 --> 00:33:09,090
hands<font color="#E5E5E5"> straight up in the air spread your</font>

00:33:06,359 --> 00:33:11,519
fingers as wide as you can open your

895
00:33:09,089 --> 00:33:13,109
mouth as wide as you can and that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

896
00:33:11,519 --> 00:33:15,839
toughest one for most<font color="#E5E5E5"> people i mean just</font>

897
00:33:13,109 --> 00:33:18,899
stretch your jaw open and then begin

898
00:33:15,839 --> 00:33:22,289
leaning backwards as far as you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

899
00:33:18,900 --> 00:33:24,540
breathing<font color="#CCCCCC"> in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that position you'll most</font>

900
00:33:22,289 --> 00:33:25,950
people if they have a high charge most

901
00:33:24,539 --> 00:33:27,809
men with high charge will start

902
00:33:25,950 --> 00:33:29,789
vibrating they'll either start choking

903
00:33:27,809 --> 00:33:32,129
and having to<font color="#E5E5E5"> figure out how to breathe</font>

904
00:33:29,789 --> 00:33:33,629
in this stress position or the<font color="#E5E5E5"> whole</font>

905
00:33:32,130 --> 00:33:35,910
body starts vibrating and shaking

906
00:33:33,630 --> 00:33:38,130
uncontrollably and most people freak out

907
00:33:35,910 --> 00:33:40,440
but<font color="#E5E5E5"> the idea is to allow that to happen</font>

908
00:33:38,130 --> 00:33:42,300
because<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's essentially your desire to</font>

909
00:33:40,440 --> 00:33:43,890
breathe in that stressful position it's

910
00:33:42,299 --> 00:33:45,539
fighting against the muscular tension in

911
00:33:43,890 --> 00:33:46,860
your belly in your chest and your neck

912
00:33:45,539 --> 00:33:50,220
and your face in<font color="#CCCCCC"> your throat pelvic</font>

913
00:33:46,859 --> 00:33:52,139
floor and it's very uncomfortable<font color="#E5E5E5"> yet</font>

914
00:33:50,220 --> 00:33:54,360
it's also very powerful and after a<font color="#CCCCCC"> few</font>

915
00:33:52,140 --> 00:33:56,040
minutes<font color="#E5E5E5"> of doing it you'll</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know that</font>

916
00:33:54,359 --> 00:33:58,709
you're breathing deeper simply because

917
00:33:56,039 --> 00:34:01,230
your voice will get deeper because

918
00:33:58,710 --> 00:34:03,329
there's no tension in your throat any

919
00:34:01,230 --> 00:34:06,809
longer in your chest and in your belly

920
00:34:03,329 --> 00:34:10,440
and you'll just feel very common and

921
00:34:06,809 --> 00:34:14,909
grounded and relaxed and focused that's

922
00:34:10,440 --> 00:34:17,880
one form of a bioenergetic yoga type

923
00:34:14,909 --> 00:34:20,460
exercise that would support you in being

924
00:34:17,880 --> 00:34:22,619
able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to breathe into your balls you know</font>

925
00:34:20,460 --> 00:34:24,240
it seems<font color="#E5E5E5"> like</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that would</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> be something</font>

928
00:34:25,168 --> 00:34:29,578
on the<font color="#CCCCCC"> daily and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> not get frustrated with</font>

and I know you didn't start<font color="#E5E5E5"> off being</font>

932
00:34:32,639 --> 00:34:37,260
way up and talk about<font color="#E5E5E5"> how you got</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to the</font>

935
00:34:38,608 --> 00:34:42,239
emotional and mental strength was even

936
00:34:40,829 --> 00:34:44,639
important in the first place because you

937
00:34:42,239 --> 00:34:47,908
were doing<font color="#E5E5E5"> strongman stuff you took a</font>

938

00:34:51,960 --> 00:34:56,699
is crucial and is actually possibly as

942
00:34:54,960 --> 00:34:59,670
important or more important than the

I've always been a body person like I

00:35:21,568 --> 00:35:24,869
described earlier I've always been into

955
00:35:23,190 --> 00:35:26,579
exercise I've always been into physical

fitness I've always been into sports I

957
00:35:26,579 --> 00:35:32,910
but my focus has always been on the<font color="#E5E5E5"> body</font>

958
00:35:29,568 --> 00:35:35,159
there was a point<font color="#CCCCCC"> in which I became kind</font>

959
00:35:32,909 --> 00:35:37,348
of depressed I was<font color="#E5E5E5"> probably about 23</font>

960
00:35:35,159 --> 00:35:40,259
years old and in my experience 23 years

<font color="#CCCCCC">on earth is one of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> those transition</font>

00:35:42,449 --> 00:35:47,460
a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of different</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> options and ambiguity</font>

964
00:35:44,519 --> 00:35:49,588
about where to go what to do and we

965
00:35:47,460 --> 00:35:51,568
start growing up but not sure for men

yet or all these different things<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

questions<font color="#CCCCCC"> that come in and went through</font>

970
00:35:56,760 --> 00:35:59,670
a slight bout of depression but you know

971
00:35:58,530 --> 00:36:01,470
not the type where I'm going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to stay</font>

972
00:35:59,670 --> 00:36:03,329
there I'm never to type to stay anywhere

973
00:36:01,469 --> 00:36:05,338
too long especially it doesn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> feel</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> good</font>

974
00:36:03,329 --> 00:36:07,890
and I started studying<font color="#E5E5E5"> meditation i came</font>

975
00:36:05,338 --> 00:36:11,759
across the ideas of a man named<font color="#CCCCCC"> Osho</font>

976
00:36:07,889 --> 00:36:14,400
also known as<font color="#CCCCCC"> rajneesh and he's long</font>

977
00:36:11,760 --> 00:36:18,569
passed away now but his whole mission in

978
00:36:14,400 --> 00:36:20,400
life was to bring meditation to the west

979
00:36:18,568 --> 00:36:23,190
and he's done a tremendous job in doing

980
00:36:20,400 --> 00:36:25,289
that but it wasn't so simple as well sit

981
00:36:23,190 --> 00:36:29,010
down<font color="#CCCCCC"> and meditate right he realized that</font>

982
00:36:25,289 --> 00:36:32,460
<font color="#E5E5E5">the Western mind body has far more</font>

983
00:36:29,010 --> 00:36:34,440
charge than the<font color="#E5E5E5"> Easterns where a lot of</font>

984
00:36:32,460 --> 00:36:36,298
these<font color="#CCCCCC"> ideas first came from and might be</font>

985
00:36:34,440 --> 00:36:38,220
easy to tell someone growing up in the

986
00:36:36,298 --> 00:36:39,099
<font color="#CCCCCC">Indian culture you know typically of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

987
00:36:38,219 --> 00:36:41,078
traditional Indian

988
00:36:39,099 --> 00:36:42,249
well you meditate well of course yeah or

989
00:36:41,079 --> 00:36:44,589
to tell someone from the traditional

990
00:36:42,248 --> 00:36:46,478
Chinese culture well you've got to do

999
00:37:02,739 --> 00:37:05,978
it's kind of a difficult<font color="#CCCCCC"> thing to tell</font>

1000
00:37:04,329 --> 00:37:08,048
most Westerners especially Western men

1001
00:37:05,978 --> 00:37:10,268
American men well now go meditate

1002
00:37:08,048 --> 00:37:12,309
without seeming as if you're castrating

1003
00:37:10,268 --> 00:37:15,308
yourself right especially given<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

1004
00:37:12,309 --> 00:37:17,349
religion of<font color="#E5E5E5"> science in the west where we</font>

1005
00:37:15,309 --> 00:37:21,339
essentially respect<font color="#E5E5E5"> only that which can</font>

he decided or discovered and he was also

1008
00:37:23,469 --> 00:37:29,498
a big fan of Wilhelm Reich I think Reich

1009
00:37:26,949 --> 00:37:31,389
died before he did the guy was not just

1010
00:37:29,498 --> 00:37:34,058
a mystic but he was a university

1011
00:37:31,389 --> 00:37:36,909
professor and he taught psychology and

1012
00:37:34,059 --> 00:37:39,339
philosophy so he's<font color="#E5E5E5"> well-read and he</font>

1013
00:37:36,909 --> 00:37:41,318
understood quite a bit and he devised a

1014
00:37:39,338 --> 00:37:43,719
form of meditation<font color="#E5E5E5"> very similar to</font>

1015
00:37:41,318 --> 00:37:45,940
bioenergetics bioenergetics is the term

1016
00:37:43,719 --> 00:37:48,309
I used to describe a lot of this he

1017
00:37:45,940 --> 00:37:51,159
called it active meditation active

1018
00:37:48,309 --> 00:37:54,150
meditation if I could describe<font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font>

1019
00:37:51,159 --> 00:37:56,858
briefly is basically get all your

1020
00:37:54,150 --> 00:37:58,450
sillies out my children watch a show

1021
00:37:56,858 --> 00:37:59,978
called Yo Gabba Gabba where they teach

1022
00:37:58,449 --> 00:38:01,449
children you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know there's one</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> segment in</font>

1023
00:37:59,978 --> 00:38:03,338
<font color="#E5E5E5">the shower and put on a song it says get</font>

1024
00:38:01,449 --> 00:38:06,098
your sillies out shake your sillies out

1025
00:38:03,338 --> 00:38:07,900
and children basically<font color="#E5E5E5"> shake their face</font>

1026
00:38:06,099 --> 00:38:09,999
and end they jump around and they shake

1027
00:38:07,900 --> 00:38:11,680
their body and they they laugh or they

1028
00:38:09,998 --> 00:38:13,478
just they start<font color="#CCCCCC"> throwing things around</font>

1029
00:38:11,679 --> 00:38:15,759
<font color="#E5E5E5">like my kids will just like they'll roll</font>

1030
00:38:13,478 --> 00:38:17,348
and do backflips and then it<font color="#E5E5E5"> just go</font>

1031
00:38:15,759 --> 00:38:20,380
nuts just go nuts for a little while

1032
00:38:17,349 --> 00:38:21,579
because there's so much tension and you

1033
00:38:20,380 --> 00:38:22,778
know<font color="#E5E5E5"> this with children there's so much</font>

1034
00:38:21,579 --> 00:38:24,430
tension in their bodies because they're

1035
00:38:22,778 --> 00:38:27,608
so active there's so much<font color="#E5E5E5"> energy and</font>

1036
00:38:24,429 --> 00:38:30,699
aliveness vitality that they just<font color="#E5E5E5"> have</font>

1037
00:38:27,608 --> 00:38:32,679
<font color="#CCCCCC">to get it out and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> if you don't as we get</font>

1038
00:38:30,699 --> 00:38:34,808
<font color="#CCCCCC">older of course we get more conditioned</font>

1039
00:38:32,679 --> 00:38:38,558
by society and<font color="#E5E5E5"> we have more shame in our</font>

1040
00:38:34,809 --> 00:38:41,048
body but the necessity for physical

1041
00:38:38,559 --> 00:38:44,278
release for catharsis if you will for

1042
00:38:41,048 --> 00:38:47,018
shaking<font color="#E5E5E5"> your sillies out never goes away</font>

1043
00:38:44,278 --> 00:38:49,568
you see so again I've got four children

1044
00:38:47,018 --> 00:38:51,399
so they're they're far more grounded

1045
00:38:49,568 --> 00:38:52,838
they're far more centered they're far

1046
00:38:51,400 --> 00:38:54,969
more available

1047
00:38:52,838 --> 00:38:58,210
after bouts of physical activity<font color="#CCCCCC"> its</font>

1048
00:38:54,969 --> 00:39:00,369
namely unstructured physical movement

1049
00:38:58,210 --> 00:39:02,759
like<font color="#E5E5E5"> shaking your sillies out so anyway</font>

1050
00:39:00,369 --> 00:39:04,749
active meditation dynamic meditation

1051
00:39:02,759 --> 00:39:06,519
appealed to me because<font color="#E5E5E5"> I was my body</font>

1052
00:39:04,748 --> 00:39:07,838
person and I saw<font color="#CCCCCC"> that well there's this</font>

1053
00:39:06,518 --> 00:39:10,689
meditation where you basically just

1054
00:39:07,838 --> 00:39:12,248
you've got 15 minutes to go nuts and do

1055
00:39:10,690 --> 00:39:14,108
whatever you want granted you're not

1056
00:39:12,248 --> 00:39:16,988
hurting another person in the room or

1057
00:39:14,108 --> 00:39:19,210
you know hurting<font color="#E5E5E5"> yourself but you just</font>

1058
00:39:16,989 --> 00:39:21,789
you shut off your brain and shake your

1059
00:39:19,210 --> 00:39:24,548
sillies out so<font color="#CCCCCC"> I went</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to a class in New</font>

1060
00:39:21,789 --> 00:39:27,489
York<font color="#E5E5E5"> City and for 21 days you do this</font>

1061
00:39:24,548 --> 00:39:29,228
form dynamic meditation at a significant

1062
00:39:27,489 --> 00:39:31,960
portion of it while shaking your sillies

1063
00:39:29,228 --> 00:39:33,368
out and<font color="#E5E5E5"> called the catharsis and I got</font>

1064
00:39:31,960 --> 00:39:35,588
involved in that way and<font color="#CCCCCC"> it felt</font>

1065
00:39:33,369 --> 00:39:39,009
tremendous it felt great I felt like<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

1066
00:39:35,588 --> 00:39:41,440
new person that the whole sense of being

1067
00:39:39,009 --> 00:39:43,690
depressed had left me because I was

1068
00:39:41,440 --> 00:39:46,088
breathing<font color="#E5E5E5"> deeper my body was softer I</font>

1069
00:39:43,690 --> 00:39:47,380
just felt tremendous I felt good so I

1070
00:39:46,088 --> 00:39:50,288
started delving a little bit deeper<font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

1071
00:39:47,380 --> 00:39:53,079
I found that there are psychoanalysts

1072
00:39:50,289 --> 00:39:54,849
there are practitioners they're not

1073
00:39:53,079 --> 00:39:57,210
necessarily respected by the medical

1074
00:39:54,849 --> 00:40:00,519
community here for one reason for<font color="#E5E5E5"> asthma</font>

1075
00:39:57,210 --> 00:40:02,499
Selby's as medication so there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> no need</font>

1076
00:40:00,518 --> 00:40:04,738
to do studies no right there's no

1077
00:40:02,498 --> 00:40:07,058
empirical studies there's no clinical

1078
00:40:04,739 --> 00:40:08,789
trials there's no way to set it up it's

1079
00:40:07,059 --> 00:40:10,960
all anecdotal so yes it becomes

1080
00:40:08,789 --> 00:40:12,819
pseudoscience which does not mean that

1081
00:40:10,960 --> 00:40:16,059
it's complete bullshit and although

1082
00:40:12,818 --> 00:40:18,548
often it does<font color="#E5E5E5"> I tend to be open in that</font>

1083
00:40:16,059 --> 00:40:21,009
way<font color="#CCCCCC"> and I got the benefits from the</font>

1084
00:40:18,548 --> 00:40:22,630
dynamic meditation so I decided to

1085
00:40:21,009 --> 00:40:25,239
<font color="#E5E5E5">develop deeper I work with a</font>

1086
00:40:22,630 --> 00:40:28,358
practitioner and here was my experience

1087
00:40:25,239 --> 00:40:31,440
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> course this is anecdotal I make</font>

1088
00:40:28,358 --> 00:40:35,858
no<font color="#CCCCCC"> claims about anything here this is my</font>

1089
00:40:31,440 --> 00:40:38,200
caveat these things<font color="#E5E5E5"> have helped me I'd</font>

1090
00:40:35,858 --> 00:40:40,119
like<font color="#CCCCCC"> to share it with you in hopes</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

1091
00:40:38,199 --> 00:40:43,328
perhaps it may be resourceful and

1092
00:40:40,119 --> 00:40:45,068
helpful to you if not that's fine<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm</font>

1093
00:40:43,329 --> 00:40:46,778
not trying<font color="#CCCCCC"> to say I'm right</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm not</font>

1094
00:40:45,068 --> 00:40:49,449
saying this is true and I'm<font color="#CCCCCC"> not saying</font>

1095
00:40:46,778 --> 00:40:51,909
everyone should believe<font color="#CCCCCC"> me or do it</font>

1096
00:40:49,449 --> 00:40:53,710
themselves I just happen to have<font color="#CCCCCC"> gained</font>

1097
00:40:51,909 --> 00:40:55,989
from it I got a big mouth so<font color="#CCCCCC"> I have to</font>

1098
00:40:53,710 --> 00:40:58,719
<font color="#E5E5E5">share the lady was a neo</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Rican</font>

1099
00:40:55,989 --> 00:41:00,759
practitioner and I walk into her office

1100
00:40:58,719 --> 00:41:02,528
and the very first thing she does is she

1101
00:41:00,759 --> 00:41:04,179
puts me into a variation of the bow

1102
00:41:02,528 --> 00:41:06,579
which is an exercise I described earlier

1103
00:41:04,179 --> 00:41:08,019
and very stressful I've never done this

1104
00:41:06,579 --> 00:41:10,690
for my life I start by<font color="#CCCCCC"> berating</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

1105
00:41:08,019 --> 00:41:12,989
shaking and then she invites me to go

1106
00:41:10,690 --> 00:41:15,789
over<font color="#CCCCCC"> to a mattress on the floor she</font>

1107
00:41:12,989 --> 00:41:18,099
invites me to proceed in humping the

1108
00:41:15,789 --> 00:41:20,079
mattress she says just we have the top

1109
00:41:18,099 --> 00:41:21,339
the mattress and<font color="#CCCCCC"> just start jamming it</font>

1110
00:41:20,079 --> 00:41:25,269
with your hips like you're humping it

1111
00:41:21,340 --> 00:41:27,250
and she just continued to provoke me<font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

1112
00:41:25,269 --> 00:41:29,009
say just<font color="#E5E5E5"> do it harder harder harder yeah</font>

1113
00:41:27,250 --> 00:41:30,969
I'm like what the fuck's<font color="#CCCCCC"> going on yeah</font>

1116
00:41:32,619 --> 00:41:37,869
uh and then I break into<font color="#E5E5E5"> laughter I</font>

1117
00:41:35,079 --> 00:41:40,389
break<font color="#E5E5E5"> into this deep laughter</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the type</font>

1118
00:41:37,869 --> 00:41:42,219
children do or you might experience when

1119
00:41:40,389 --> 00:41:44,319
you spoke to much marijuana or just

1120
00:41:42,219 --> 00:41:47,049

1126
00:41:56,679 --> 00:42:01,569
my breath and I start apologizing to her

1127
00:41:58,599 --> 00:42:03,579
saying but I'm sorry I know that this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

laughing deeply from my belly she

1134
00:42:13,750 --> 00:42:17,980
explained she said now listen I wanna

1135
00:42:15,880 --> 00:42:21,519
know what happened here and she says to

1136
00:42:17,980 --> 00:42:23,740
<font color="#CCCCCC">me</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that at some point someone told you</font>

you to sit down<font color="#E5E5E5"> and shut</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> up and to stop</font>

1140

playing you know having fun<font color="#E5E5E5"> but we're</font>

1141
00:42:30,460 --> 00:42:33,579
not supposed to have fun because you're

1142
00:42:31,900 --> 00:42:35,920
in church or in school whatever case may

1143
00:42:33,579 --> 00:42:38,380
be<font color="#CCCCCC"> and the particular area of your body</font>

1144
00:42:35,920 --> 00:42:41,920
your hips showed signs of muscular

1145
00:42:38,380 --> 00:42:43,539
rigidity due to an experience you may

1146
00:42:41,920 --> 00:42:45,610
have had now she said I can't tell you

1147
00:42:43,539 --> 00:42:47,590
exactly what<font color="#E5E5E5"> that experience was at this</font>

1148
00:42:45,610 --> 00:42:49,660

1149
00:42:47,590 --> 00:42:53,050
that this is where you had tension and

1150
00:42:49,659 --> 00:42:54,579
all i did was i gave you an exercise to

1151
00:42:53,050 --> 00:42:57,010
help break up the muscular tension in

1152
00:42:54,579 --> 00:43:00,639
that particular area when the laughter

1153
00:42:57,010 --> 00:43:06,690
broke out it was a sign of emotional

1154
00:43:00,639 --> 00:43:09,190
release and a regaining of the character

1155
00:43:06,690 --> 00:43:10,990
associated with allowing pleasure to

1162
00:43:22,489 --> 00:43:28,130
that I experienced was that ever since

and I explained there what happened the

1172
00:43:46,099 --> 00:43:51,109
day before and I knew<font color="#CCCCCC"> that something had</font>

1173
00:43:48,829 --> 00:43:52,789
changed in me deeply at that point now I

1174
00:43:51,108 --> 00:43:54,588
didn't have much time because I was busy

1175

therapy that he called bioenergetics

where there were<font color="#CCCCCC"> X similar exercises he</font>

1187
00:44:19,548 --> 00:44:23,509
would do certain things I put me into

00:44:21,228 --> 00:44:25,088
stress positions where I be forced to

1195
00:44:38,449 --> 00:44:45,019
experience this release of emotional

1196
00:44:41,929 --> 00:44:49,219
catharsis I would scream or yell or I

1197
00:44:45,018 --> 00:44:51,288
cry and<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's been hours crying there so</font>

1198
00:44:49,219 --> 00:44:53,958
my experience with the results of the

1199
00:44:51,289 --> 00:44:56,390
therapy was that I started<font color="#CCCCCC"> making better</font>

00:44:58,579 --> 00:45:03,680
my athletic ability had improved I

1203
00:45:01,159 --> 00:45:07,098
actually began looking different in my

00:45:03,679 --> 00:45:10,278
voice changed the physical change is

1205
00:45:07,099 --> 00:45:13,278
associated with the exercise also led to

<font color="#CCCCCC">all the character gems that I just</font>

described my business exploded there

1208

myself to be excellent and that sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

1220
00:45:46,369 --> 00:45:51,679
working on the<font color="#E5E5E5"> tension that you had in</font>

1221
00:45:48,469 --> 00:45:53,299
your body led to changes directly in

00:45:51,679 --> 00:45:56,000
your mind that you can attribute

1223

directly to changes in your body in

00:45:56,000 --> 00:46:01,219
fitness there's a phrase that we like to

1225
00:45:58,250 --> 00:46:02,329
use and it's the same phrase that it is

repeated<font color="#E5E5E5"> over and over again</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

1229
00:46:07,610 --> 00:46:11,720
and it's pretty likely everybody agrees
