1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,528
we got a<font color="#E5E5E5"> question from our friend who's</font>

2
00:00:01,949 --> 00:00:06,809
16 years old he lives in<font color="#E5E5E5"> Australia he's</font>

3
00:00:04,528 --> 00:00:09,030
been in foster care since he was nine

4
00:00:06,809 --> 00:00:12,449
years old and now he finds himself in a

5
00:00:09,029 --> 00:00:14,279
pretty tough situation basically<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

6
00:00:12,449 --> 00:00:18,448
woman that cares for him is foster

7
00:00:14,279 --> 00:00:20,489
parent is a 68 year old woman she

8
00:00:18,449 --> 00:00:22,920
provides all<font color="#CCCCCC"> of it for all of his needs</font>

9
00:00:20,489 --> 00:00:25,108
but she's a negative woman not

10
00:00:22,920 --> 00:00:28,980
constantly picking fights with him and

11
00:00:25,109 --> 00:00:30,750
making him feel bad our friend goes on

12
00:00:28,980 --> 00:00:32,549
to describe that he's a good kid he

13
00:00:30,750 --> 00:00:34,859
seems to<font color="#E5E5E5"> get all of his schoolwork done</font>

14
00:00:32,549 --> 00:00:36,780
he doesn't get in trouble<font color="#CCCCCC"> you know that</font>

15
00:00:34,859 --> 00:00:39,479
he spends most of his<font color="#E5E5E5"> time studying and</font>

16
00:00:36,780 --> 00:00:41,340
exercising he feels that he's<font color="#E5E5E5"> doing the</font>

17
00:00:39,479 --> 00:00:45,119
<font color="#CCCCCC">right things but yet he's constantly</font>

18
00:00:41,340 --> 00:00:50,070
being persecuted you know and beaten

19
00:00:45,119 --> 00:00:51,780
down by the poor attitude and energy of

20
00:00:50,070 --> 00:00:54,770
this woman<font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> he doesn't</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know what</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

21
00:00:51,780 --> 00:00:58,289
do<font color="#E5E5E5"> being a senior in high school he</font>

22
00:00:54,770 --> 00:01:00,539
still has you know studies and he's got

23
00:00:58,289 --> 00:01:04,739
a past test he's really busy and he

24
00:01:00,539 --> 00:01:07,349
can't see how leaving the home would

25
00:01:04,739 --> 00:01:09,090
help him because he'd have to swim on

26
00:01:07,349 --> 00:01:11,250
his own he'd have to live on his own and

27
00:01:09,090 --> 00:01:13,590
still be able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to perform in school and</font>

28
00:01:11,250 --> 00:01:16,228
stuff like that<font color="#CCCCCC"> so he is in a bind he</font>

29
00:01:13,590 --> 00:01:18,540
does not know what to do he doesn't know

30
00:01:16,228 --> 00:01:21,688
how to deal with<font color="#CCCCCC"> the situation such that</font>

31
00:01:18,540 --> 00:01:23,580
he could<font color="#E5E5E5"> continue to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> be a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> good kid but</font>

32
00:01:21,688 --> 00:01:26,429

36
00:01:30,540 --> 00:01:36,750
up some Jesus quotes for you basically

<font color="#E5E5E5">a mindset it's a type of consciousness</font>

67
00:02:42,959 --> 00:02:46,079
<font color="#E5E5E5">why would I have to follow these steps</font>

68
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:48,629
by turning my other cheek and loving

69
00:02:46,079 --> 00:02:50,099
nape and loving uh enemies in order to

70
00:02:48,628 --> 00:02:51,658
get to this kingdom place that I've

71
00:02:50,098 --> 00:02:52,949
never even seen just forget it so the

72
00:02:51,658 --> 00:02:54,959
whole<font color="#CCCCCC"> thing</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> does it make sense</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to them</font>

73
00:02:52,949 --> 00:02:56,250
but if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you approach it and read it the</font>

74
00:02:54,959 --> 00:02:59,819
way i read<font color="#CCCCCC"> and approach it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> from this</font>

75
00:02:56,250 --> 00:03:01,829
perspective<font color="#E5E5E5"> you see that what Jesus is</font>

76
00:02:59,818 --> 00:03:03,719
doing is he's again<font color="#E5E5E5"> describing what</font>

77
00:03:01,829 --> 00:03:05,129
happens when you're a<font color="#E5E5E5"> person of the</font>

78
00:03:03,719 --> 00:03:07,019
kingdom when you're a<font color="#E5E5E5"> person who is</font>

79
00:03:05,128 --> 00:03:11,669
<font color="#E5E5E5">truly at peace when you're a person who</font>

80
00:03:07,019 --> 00:03:14,759
has found joy and has come<font color="#CCCCCC"> to realize</font>

81
00:03:11,669 --> 00:03:17,399
the unity and all of<font color="#CCCCCC"> earth and in life</font>

82
00:03:14,759 --> 00:03:20,729
and that type of person is a type of

83
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:23,069
<font color="#CCCCCC">person that can love his enemy that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> can</font>

84
00:03:20,729 --> 00:03:24,568
turn his cheek it's not<font color="#CCCCCC"> that he's doing</font>

85
00:03:23,068 --> 00:03:27,208
<font color="#CCCCCC">it so that he can be from the kingdom</font>

86
00:03:24,568 --> 00:03:29,969
it's that he is a man of the kingdom so

87
00:03:27,209 --> 00:03:34,979
he does that stuff and what<font color="#E5E5E5"> that means</font>

88
00:03:29,969 --> 00:03:37,560
is that he's detached from the physical

89
00:03:34,979 --> 00:03:38,909
<font color="#CCCCCC">world in a way you know in other words</font>

90
00:03:37,560 --> 00:03:40,560
he's not so attached to what other

91
00:03:38,909 --> 00:03:42,750
people are doing or saying to him

92
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:44,669
because he's found peace in his heart

93
00:03:42,750 --> 00:03:47,219
<font color="#E5E5E5">and no matter</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> how much someone slaps you</font>

94
00:03:44,669 --> 00:03:49,500
or how much<font color="#E5E5E5"> someone poses themselves to</font>

95
00:03:47,219 --> 00:03:51,810
be an enemy<font color="#CCCCCC"> of you they can't reach the</font>

96
00:03:49,500 --> 00:03:54,719
inside they can't reach the kingdom

97
00:03:51,810 --> 00:03:58,169
which is inside you the<font color="#E5E5E5"> kingdom is deep</font>

98
00:03:54,719 --> 00:04:00,959
within<font color="#E5E5E5"> and you can detach yourself from</font>

99
00:03:58,169 --> 00:04:05,430
all of the trappings in the world that

100
00:04:00,959 --> 00:04:07,560
<font color="#E5E5E5">will destroy the kingdom within you now</font>

101
00:04:05,430 --> 00:04:10,169
I know this is all metaphorical and

102
00:04:07,560 --> 00:04:12,870
spiritual and religious the point is the

103
00:04:10,169 --> 00:04:14,250
take-home point is<font color="#E5E5E5"> for you is you're</font>

104
00:04:12,870 --> 00:04:15,900
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to have to live</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> with the slaps in</font>

105
00:04:14,250 --> 00:04:17,668
your face for<font color="#E5E5E5"> a little bit longer you're</font>

106
00:04:15,900 --> 00:04:21,090
gonna have<font color="#E5E5E5"> to live with your</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> enemy a</font>

107
00:04:17,668 --> 00:04:24,439
little bit<font color="#E5E5E5"> longer but if you decide to</font>

108
00:04:21,089 --> 00:04:26,569
go searching<font color="#CCCCCC"> for that kingdom right</font>

109
00:04:24,439 --> 00:04:29,728
finding inner peace

110
00:04:26,569 --> 00:04:31,560
go looking<font color="#E5E5E5"> for inner peace what you're</font>

111
00:04:29,728 --> 00:04:35,219
going to find is that you're going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

112
00:04:31,560 --> 00:04:36,959
<font color="#E5E5E5">love your enemy you're going to turn the</font>

113
00:04:35,220 --> 00:04:39,169
other cheek not because<font color="#E5E5E5"> you have to but</font>

114
00:04:36,959 --> 00:04:42,448
because it's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be who you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> are</font>

115
00:04:39,168 --> 00:04:45,389
some of the ways to help you approach

116
00:04:42,449 --> 00:04:47,610
this place this kingdom this place of

117
00:04:45,389 --> 00:04:52,668
inner peace is through meditation

118
00:04:47,610 --> 00:04:55,650
through prayer through mindfulness

119
00:04:52,668 --> 00:04:57,359
conscious awareness these are<font color="#CCCCCC"> all things</font>

you when<font color="#E5E5E5"> someone is approaching you in a</font>

negative fashion just being aware and
