1
00:00:01,010 --> 00:00:08,279
good morning y'all I guess you could

2
00:00:05,339 --> 00:00:11,010
imagine where I'm headed that's right

3
00:00:08,279 --> 00:00:14,009
strengthcamp and you probably also

4
00:00:11,009 --> 00:00:17,490
notice that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I haven't been uploading on</font>

5
00:00:14,009 --> 00:00:19,500
this Elliott Hulse channel very<font color="#E5E5E5"> often</font>

6
00:00:17,489 --> 00:00:22,649
this week in fact<font color="#CCCCCC"> I've uploaded three</font>

7
00:00:19,500 --> 00:00:25,618
videos to<font color="#CCCCCC"> the strength camp channel this</font>

8
00:00:22,649 --> 00:00:27,509
week and none on my la health channel so

9
00:00:25,618 --> 00:00:31,109
and what you guys think I'm neglecting

10
00:00:27,510 --> 00:00:33,300
you in fact it is my assumption that if

11
00:00:31,109 --> 00:00:36,510
you're serious about being the strong

12
00:00:33,299 --> 00:00:41,159
<font color="#CCCCCC">was versioning yourself you're committed</font>

13
00:00:36,509 --> 00:00:44,218
you're an action taker and you like what

14
00:00:41,159 --> 00:00:46,288
I have<font color="#CCCCCC"> to say in my videos then you</font>

15
00:00:44,219 --> 00:00:51,620
should be a subscriber to everything

16
00:00:46,289 --> 00:00:59,510
<font color="#E5E5E5">Elliott Hulse or shrimp camp related so</font>

17
00:00:51,619 --> 00:00:59,509
<font color="#E5E5E5">YouTube channels Facebook instagrams so</font>

18
00:01:02,159 --> 00:01:07,899
felt neglected that's because you're<font color="#CCCCCC"> not</font>

19
00:01:04,448 --> 00:01:09,368
connected bro to get on<font color="#CCCCCC"> that anyway I'm</font>

20
00:01:07,900 --> 00:01:11,978
heading over there right now because I'm

21
00:01:09,368 --> 00:01:13,810
<font color="#E5E5E5">going to film another video for shrimp</font>

22
00:01:11,978 --> 00:01:16,149
camp because I've<font color="#CCCCCC"> been doing a lot of</font>

23
00:01:13,810 --> 00:01:19,420
<font color="#E5E5E5">things at the gym lately namely to help</font>

24
00:01:16,149 --> 00:01:22,629
my wife out but also I went there the

25
00:01:19,420 --> 00:01:27,009
other day to interview dr. far on our

26
00:01:22,629 --> 00:01:28,209
resident neuroscientist so so I figured

27
00:01:27,009 --> 00:01:29,649
<font color="#CCCCCC">since all those things took place at</font>

28
00:01:28,209 --> 00:01:32,469
strength camp and all those things<font color="#E5E5E5"> are</font>

29
00:01:29,649 --> 00:01:34,329
fitness fish related even though even

30
00:01:32,469 --> 00:01:36,849
though<font color="#E5E5E5"> everything is related you know</font>

31
00:01:34,329 --> 00:01:39,099
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> body is the mind those were fitness</font>

32
00:01:36,849 --> 00:01:40,299
related type things so I put it on the

33
00:01:39,099 --> 00:01:55,239
front can't<font color="#CCCCCC"> channel</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and that's basically</font>

34
00:01:40,299 --> 00:02:00,640
how I'm gonna roll drinking my high<font color="#CCCCCC"> ph</font>

35
00:01:55,239 --> 00:02:02,739
ionized water with sea salt I can't tell

36
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:06,000
you if the ionized water<font color="#E5E5E5"> makes a</font>

37
00:02:02,739 --> 00:02:08,618
<font color="#E5E5E5">difference but I know it's filtered and</font>

38
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:13,689
I add the sea salt like I've been doing

39
00:02:08,618 --> 00:02:18,280
<font color="#CCCCCC">for years in order to well maintained a</font>

40
00:02:13,689 --> 00:02:21,159
certain mineral equilibrium within the

41
00:02:18,280 --> 00:02:24,580
body most of you probably know you

42
00:02:21,159 --> 00:02:27,219
learned in school that human the fluid

43
00:02:24,580 --> 00:02:33,239
in the human body blood had the same or

44
00:02:27,219 --> 00:02:36,300
very similar<font color="#CCCCCC"> well I understand identical</font>

45
00:02:33,239 --> 00:02:38,439
sodium and mineral content as<font color="#CCCCCC"> VC</font>

46
00:02:36,300 --> 00:02:41,260
interestingly enough there<font color="#CCCCCC"> are those</font>

47
00:02:38,439 --> 00:02:46,139
that say we crawled up out of the sea so

48
00:02:41,259 --> 00:02:46,139
anyway maintaining connectedness

49
00:02:46,409 --> 00:02:52,590
to our roots to our biological roots

50
00:02:49,610 --> 00:02:56,910
make sense to me<font color="#E5E5E5"> so I try</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to find any</font>

51
00:02:52,590 --> 00:02:58,890
opportunity to<font color="#E5E5E5"> do that so that's it</font>

52
00:02:56,909 --> 00:03:00,329
anyway I'm going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to cut this video short</font>

53
00:02:58,889 --> 00:03:01,859
because I'm rambling and I'm trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

54
00:03:00,330 --> 00:03:04,500
get through traffic while talking at the

55
00:03:01,860 --> 00:03:06,420
same time Jane a good idea to make for

56
00:03:04,500 --> 00:03:09,930
good videos and<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't make for good</font>

57
00:03:06,419 --> 00:03:11,369
driving so i'll see you guys on the

58
00:03:09,930 --> 00:03:16,909
<font color="#E5E5E5">other channel because i'll be uploading</font>

59
00:03:11,370 --> 00:03:16,909
them at the same time done
