1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,278
so the youngest<font color="#E5E5E5"> of my four children is</font>

2
00:00:01,679 --> 00:00:07,318
my son<font color="#CCCCCC"> Benjamin he'll be two in July so</font>

3
00:00:05,278 --> 00:00:10,410
it was still very tied to his primal

4
00:00:07,318 --> 00:00:11,910
instincts and his nature you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> he we</font>

5
00:00:10,410 --> 00:00:15,240
haven't conditioned him<font color="#CCCCCC"> Tenny great</font>

6
00:00:11,910 --> 00:00:17,550
degree yet so he does things that<font color="#E5E5E5"> are</font>

7
00:00:15,240 --> 00:00:19,769
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> come natural to him when he becomes</font>

8
00:00:17,550 --> 00:00:21,868
upset like throws a temper tantrum

9
00:00:19,769 --> 00:00:24,000
whenever we take something away from him

10
00:00:21,868 --> 00:00:26,550
or you know tell<font color="#E5E5E5"> me they can't have</font>

11
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:28,559
something<font color="#E5E5E5"> he gets very upset and he runs</font>

12
00:00:26,550 --> 00:00:30,480
towards the first inanimate object that

13
00:00:28,559 --> 00:00:34,320
he could find with his hands<font color="#CCCCCC"> like this</font>

14
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:36,719
and it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not like this and goes to bite</font>

15
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:38,460
it so if it's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> table you'll go and try</font>

16
00:00:36,719 --> 00:00:40,140
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> bite the table you'll try to bite the</font>

17
00:00:38,460 --> 00:00:41,340
couch and it's like it<font color="#E5E5E5"> really doesn't</font>

18
00:00:40,140 --> 00:00:43,799
matter what it<font color="#CCCCCC"> is it's just</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that his</font>

19
00:00:41,340 --> 00:00:45,210
mouth goes open<font color="#CCCCCC"> his teeth show and it's</font>

20
00:00:43,799 --> 00:00:47,788
like whatever is in my way<font color="#CCCCCC"> is gonna</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> get</font>

21
00:00:45,210 --> 00:00:50,308
<font color="#E5E5E5">bitten he's tried to bite us before and</font>

22
00:00:47,789 --> 00:00:54,719
<font color="#CCCCCC">it's like</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we gotta handle that can't</font>

23
00:00:50,308 --> 00:00:57,299
bite people yeah so it got<font color="#CCCCCC"> me thinking</font>

24
00:00:54,719 --> 00:01:00,270
about<font color="#E5E5E5"> the significance of the mouth</font>

25
00:00:57,299 --> 00:01:04,709
because in one<font color="#E5E5E5"> light the mouth can be</font>

26
00:01:00,270 --> 00:01:07,260
<font color="#E5E5E5">used as a organ of tenderness you're</font>

27
00:01:04,709 --> 00:01:11,188
kissing your lover it's soft<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's</font>

28
00:01:07,260 --> 00:01:13,650
relaxed<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's receptive and it brings</font>

29
00:01:11,188 --> 00:01:17,669
pleasure but it could also be<font color="#CCCCCC"> used as</font>

30
00:01:13,650 --> 00:01:19,680
aggression are you bite just tear people

31
00:01:17,670 --> 00:01:21,478
apart with your tongue even<font color="#E5E5E5"> just say</font>

32
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:23,970
things<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> really hurt people's</font>

33
00:01:21,478 --> 00:01:25,879
feelings but specifically physically is

34
00:01:23,969 --> 00:01:29,069
what I'm talking about kissing or biting

35
00:01:25,879 --> 00:01:33,390
the thing is<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> if we don't fully</font>

36
00:01:29,069 --> 00:01:35,728
<font color="#E5E5E5">express certain negative or aggressive</font>

37
00:01:33,390 --> 00:01:36,780
emotions that become trapped in our

38
00:01:35,728 --> 00:01:39,959
muscles and that's why a lot of people

39
00:01:36,780 --> 00:01:42,030
have really tight jaws tight a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

40
00:01:39,959 --> 00:01:44,280
tension in their face<font color="#CCCCCC"> and what</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that does</font>

41
00:01:42,030 --> 00:01:47,728
also<font color="#E5E5E5"> is it it stops your ability to</font>

42
00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:50,879
relax<font color="#E5E5E5"> into pleasure and to offer the</font>

43
00:01:47,728 --> 00:01:52,228
organ for tenderness because you're you

44
00:01:50,879 --> 00:01:53,640
know you're stiff lipped that's where

45
00:01:52,228 --> 00:01:56,340
the term comes from so I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> not making</font>

46
00:01:53,640 --> 00:01:58,079
<font color="#CCCCCC">this shit up stiff lips really tight ja</font>

47
00:01:56,340 --> 00:02:00,290
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> ever noticed was really tight</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> jawed</font>

48
00:01:58,078 --> 00:02:02,489
that's because there's they want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to bite</font>

49
00:02:00,290 --> 00:02:05,579
essentially they know you can't bite

50
00:02:02,489 --> 00:02:06,929
people but that instinct to bite<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be</font>

51
00:02:05,578 --> 00:02:08,728
to aggress

52
00:02:06,930 --> 00:02:10,800
especially through anger has been

53
00:02:08,729 --> 00:02:12,750
<font color="#E5E5E5">suppressed and gets trapped in the</font>

54
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:13,890
muscles so we don't want<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> share</font>

55
00:02:12,750 --> 00:02:16,169
something with you today this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is really</font>

56
00:02:13,889 --> 00:02:18,029
important<font color="#CCCCCC"> because if you want to be the</font>

57
00:02:16,169 --> 00:02:20,819
strongest version<font color="#E5E5E5"> of yourself one of the</font>

58
00:02:18,030 --> 00:02:23,520
<font color="#E5E5E5">things that might be nice to access is</font>

59
00:02:20,819 --> 00:02:25,530
the tenderness of them out want to be a

60
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:27,689
good<font color="#E5E5E5"> lover right without the aggression</font>

61
00:02:25,530 --> 00:02:30,150
tightness in your jaw and inability to

62
00:02:27,689 --> 00:02:31,169
receive and give pleasure so you got to

63
00:02:30,150 --> 00:02:33,450
get<font color="#E5E5E5"> that fucking tension out of your</font>

mouth as wide as you can this one works

85
00:03:40,949 --> 00:03:45,119
for me a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> better than the towel press</font>

86
00:03:43,500 --> 00:03:46,229
hard against<font color="#E5E5E5"> those muscles because</font>

00:03:46,229 --> 00:03:49,738
you're massaging it while you got<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

93
00:04:05,050 --> 00:04:08,320
<font color="#E5E5E5">the exercise as opposed to watching</font>

94
00:04:06,729 --> 00:04:10,590

95
00:04:08,319 --> 00:04:13,239
neurotic about your behavior the more

96
00:04:10,590 --> 00:04:14,680
