1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,879
I know this might<font color="#E5E5E5"> not make sense and</font>

2
00:00:01,800 --> 00:00:04,290
<font color="#E5E5E5">it's probably gonna sound kind of</font>

3
00:00:02,879 --> 00:00:08,880
strange but today I'm making this video

4
00:00:04,290 --> 00:00:11,490
to show my gratitude to<font color="#E5E5E5"> you for you</font>

5
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:13,320
showing gratitude to me and what I mean

6
00:00:11,490 --> 00:00:15,870
by that<font color="#CCCCCC"> is that earlier this week I was</font>

7
00:00:13,320 --> 00:00:17,820
unindicted with emails and a<font color="#E5E5E5"> video that</font>

8
00:00:15,869 --> 00:00:21,118
I'll share with you in a moment from you

9
00:00:17,820 --> 00:00:23,579
guys sharing how happy you are or

10
00:00:21,118 --> 00:00:25,740
grateful you feel<font color="#E5E5E5"> for the things that I</font>

11
00:00:23,579 --> 00:00:28,259
do<font color="#CCCCCC"> for you basically the videos that I</font>

12
00:00:25,739 --> 00:00:29,788
make and really I don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> think too much</font>

13
00:00:28,260 --> 00:00:31,830
about it I make these videos because I

14
00:00:29,789 --> 00:00:34,350
enjoy<font color="#E5E5E5"> making them I I genuinely feel</font>

15
00:00:31,829 --> 00:00:36,539
good to<font color="#E5E5E5"> answer questions share my ideas</font>

16
00:00:34,350 --> 00:00:39,420
and whatever wisdom I've accumulated

17
00:00:36,539 --> 00:00:43,738
over<font color="#E5E5E5"> the past 33 years with people in</font>

18
00:00:39,420 --> 00:00:47,520
<font color="#E5E5E5">these videos and and I'm not shocked but</font>

19
00:00:43,738 --> 00:00:50,009
I'm taken back by how much of<font color="#CCCCCC"> impacts of</font>

20
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:52,350
an impact a lot of my words have had in

21
00:00:50,009 --> 00:00:54,929
some of your lives the stories that

22
00:00:52,350 --> 00:00:56,670
<font color="#E5E5E5">you've shared with me the the change of</font>

23
00:00:54,929 --> 00:00:58,769
heart the evolution that you've

24
00:00:56,670 --> 00:01:01,500
experienced just<font color="#E5E5E5"> by simple things that</font>

25
00:00:58,770 --> 00:01:04,019
I've shared<font color="#E5E5E5"> in these videos makes me</font>

26
00:01:01,500 --> 00:01:06,420
feel<font color="#CCCCCC"> great and then for you to share</font>

27
00:01:04,019 --> 00:01:10,650
<font color="#E5E5E5">your gratitude with me makes me feel</font>

28
00:01:06,420 --> 00:01:13,260
even more it's a weird mix of feelings

29
00:01:10,650 --> 00:01:15,210
it's almost<font color="#E5E5E5"> like I'm grateful for your</font>

30
00:01:13,260 --> 00:01:17,759
gratitude and it makes me<font color="#E5E5E5"> want to give</font>

31
00:01:15,209 --> 00:01:20,429
back even<font color="#CCCCCC"> more so I said to my wife I</font>

32
00:01:17,759 --> 00:01:23,099
was like I'm so happy I was brought to

33
00:01:20,430 --> 00:01:25,350
tears almost with all of these the

34
00:01:23,099 --> 00:01:28,709
gratitude and<font color="#E5E5E5"> and the nice things that</font>

35
00:01:25,349 --> 00:01:32,819
you guys had to say and I also had a

36
00:01:28,709 --> 00:01:34,889
mixed feeling of now i owe them right

37
00:01:32,819 --> 00:01:36,269
it's almost<font color="#E5E5E5"> like when someone you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> sent</font>

38
00:01:34,890 --> 00:01:37,650
someone a gift they send you a thank-you

39
00:01:36,269 --> 00:01:40,519
card and you thank them<font color="#E5E5E5"> for the thank</font>

40
00:01:37,650 --> 00:01:42,990
you card and it doesn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> end it won't end</font>

41
00:01:40,519 --> 00:01:44,188
because thank you<font color="#E5E5E5"> for the thank you card</font>

42
00:01:42,989 --> 00:01:46,319
well thank you<font color="#E5E5E5"> for thanking me for the</font>

43
00:01:44,188 --> 00:01:48,389
thank you card and it can get crazy but

44
00:01:46,319 --> 00:01:51,539
I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's the energy associated</font>

45
00:01:48,390 --> 00:01:53,728
with that reciprocation going back and

46
00:01:51,540 --> 00:01:54,868
forth sharing here's something for you

47
00:01:53,728 --> 00:01:57,659
here's something for you here's

48
00:01:54,868 --> 00:02:00,540
something for you and it's a dance it's

49
00:01:57,659 --> 00:02:03,329
it's it's a beautiful dance that we get

50
00:02:00,540 --> 00:02:05,100
involved<font color="#CCCCCC"> with that really shows that we</font>

51
00:02:03,328 --> 00:02:08,639
need<font color="#CCCCCC"> each other I make these videos</font>

52
00:02:05,099 --> 00:02:10,258
because my heart compels me to you watch

53
00:02:08,639 --> 00:02:11,669
the videos

54
00:02:10,258 --> 00:02:13,979
is that perhaps<font color="#E5E5E5"> there's something in my</font>

55
00:02:11,669 --> 00:02:15,719
words that are resourceful to you you

56
00:02:13,979 --> 00:02:17,699
<font color="#E5E5E5">thank me for the videos I feel good</font>

57
00:02:15,719 --> 00:02:19,769
<font color="#E5E5E5">about making more videos and want to</font>

58
00:02:17,699 --> 00:02:21,389
show my<font color="#CCCCCC"> appreciation to you for watching</font>

59
00:02:19,769 --> 00:02:23,519
the videos and this is just<font color="#CCCCCC"> a simple</font>

60
00:02:21,389 --> 00:02:26,548
<font color="#CCCCCC">example but we see it all through life I</font>

61
00:02:23,519 --> 00:02:29,189
often talk about dualism now there's a

62
00:02:26,549 --> 00:02:31,409
balance there's a dance in all of nature

63
00:02:29,189 --> 00:02:33,269
there's no winter without summer there's

64
00:02:31,408 --> 00:02:36,658
no night without day there's no mail

65
00:02:33,269 --> 00:02:39,379
without female there's this magnificent

66
00:02:36,658 --> 00:02:43,500
duality that creates all the power that

67
00:02:39,378 --> 00:02:46,280
<font color="#E5E5E5">animates the world and the power between</font>

68
00:02:43,500 --> 00:02:48,719
our communion our communication our

69
00:02:46,280 --> 00:02:51,719
relationship even though it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> only</font>

70
00:02:48,719 --> 00:02:54,689
through video is powerful it's very

71
00:02:51,719 --> 00:02:58,219
powerful<font color="#E5E5E5"> and I'm convinced</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that by my</font>

72
00:02:54,689 --> 00:03:01,169
sharing just a few<font color="#CCCCCC"> simple words ideas or</font>

73
00:02:58,219 --> 00:03:03,299
providing some wisdom based on my 33

74
00:03:01,169 --> 00:03:08,908
years of existence here on earth with

75
00:03:03,299 --> 00:03:11,099
you would not only have you reciprocate

76
00:03:08,908 --> 00:03:14,459
by sharing your gratitude with me but

77
00:03:11,098 --> 00:03:17,128
also give you more strength to number

78
00:03:14,459 --> 00:03:20,789
one share<font color="#E5E5E5"> with other</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> people share your</font>

79
00:03:17,128 --> 00:03:25,590
strength with other people and number

80
00:03:20,789 --> 00:03:31,168
<font color="#CCCCCC">two feel strong enough and be confident</font>

81
00:03:25,590 --> 00:03:32,819
enough and have permission to become<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

82
00:03:31,169 --> 00:03:35,579
strongest version of yourself because

83
00:03:32,818 --> 00:03:37,619
that in and of itself and I say this<font color="#E5E5E5"> all</font>

84
00:03:35,579 --> 00:03:39,359
the time just becoming the strongest

85
00:03:37,620 --> 00:03:41,819
version of yourself changes your

86
00:03:39,359 --> 00:03:45,989
sentiment changes your heart changes who

87
00:03:41,818 --> 00:03:49,018
you are and through transference people

88
00:03:45,989 --> 00:03:51,480
change around you you become<font color="#E5E5E5"> stronger</font>

89
00:03:49,019 --> 00:03:53,158
your friends have no choice<font color="#CCCCCC"> but to get</font>

90
00:03:51,479 --> 00:03:55,318
stronger to<font color="#E5E5E5"> keep up with you either that</font>

91
00:03:53,158 --> 00:03:57,418
or they resent you become haters and

92
00:03:55,318 --> 00:03:59,250
then just fall<font color="#CCCCCC"> to the wayside and that's</font>

93
00:03:57,419 --> 00:04:01,859
<font color="#E5E5E5">going to happen and that's a part of</font>

94
00:03:59,250 --> 00:04:03,568
what<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> expect on this journey anyway I</font>

95
00:04:01,859 --> 00:04:06,269
don't want to<font color="#CCCCCC"> make this video much</font>

96
00:04:03,568 --> 00:04:08,818
longer<font color="#CCCCCC"> than</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it needs to be so I'm going</font>

97
00:04:06,269 --> 00:04:11,219

hey how you feeling Elliot I had a quick

101
00:04:16,379 --> 00:04:22,110
question being that I<font color="#E5E5E5"> am on my own</font>

102
00:04:19,379 --> 00:04:25,649
to building a business using<font color="#CCCCCC"> my services</font>

103
00:04:22,110 --> 00:04:28,980
and my insight on on personal growth you

104
00:04:25,649 --> 00:04:31,259
know it's it's it's a through my talents

105
00:04:28,980 --> 00:04:34,560
and you know in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the arts so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ask</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> what are</font>

106
00:04:31,259 --> 00:04:37,379
you what I'm looking to do I just had a

107
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:39,420
quick<font color="#CCCCCC"> question and comment up on this</font>

108
00:04:37,379 --> 00:04:41,909
passage and one of the books that I'm

109
00:04:39,420 --> 00:04:46,770
reading it's called the business of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

110
00:04:41,910 --> 00:04:48,480
21st century by robert kiyosaki and<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

111
00:04:46,769 --> 00:04:52,109
might have read it before you<font color="#E5E5E5"> go you</font>

112
00:04:48,480 --> 00:04:54,090
might have heard of<font color="#E5E5E5"> it or or even read</font>

113
00:04:52,110 --> 00:04:58,080
the quote before it goes like<font color="#CCCCCC"> this it</font>

114
00:04:54,089 --> 00:05:01,560
calls on those like no man is an island

115
00:04:58,079 --> 00:05:05,009
entire of itself every man is<font color="#E5E5E5"> a piece of</font>

116
00:05:01,560 --> 00:05:06,030
the continent a part of the main so yeah

117
00:05:05,009 --> 00:05:11,459
basically I just wanted<font color="#CCCCCC"> to get your</font>

118
00:05:06,029 --> 00:05:14,459
insight on that and that's it so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I hope</font>

I am so grateful<font color="#E5E5E5"> for your gratitude and</font>

130
00:05:38,970 --> 00:05:43,260
just to reiterate what I said earlier to

131
00:05:41,850 --> 00:05:46,620
capitalize upon the point that you made

132
00:05:43,259 --> 00:05:49,529
with<font color="#E5E5E5"> that quote we all need each other</font>

133
00:05:46,620 --> 00:05:51,209
no man is an island you're right and one

134
00:05:49,529 --> 00:05:53,909
of my favorite ways to describe that is

135
00:05:51,209 --> 00:05:58,039
that we are<font color="#E5E5E5"> all cells of a single</font>

136
00:05:53,910 --> 00:06:00,000
organism one cell separates itself and

137
00:05:58,040 --> 00:06:05,189
decides it's going to do its own thing

138
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:06,329
it's rogue we call that a cancer a cell

139
00:06:05,189 --> 00:06:08,459
that decides that is we're going to

140
00:06:06,329 --> 00:06:11,669
reject<font color="#E5E5E5"> the rest of the body that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it's</font>

141
00:06:08,459 --> 00:06:14,009
going to perpetuate its own ideal

142
00:06:11,670 --> 00:06:17,370
outside the bounds of all of the other

143
00:06:14,009 --> 00:06:20,750
cells and organelles probably i'm saying

144
00:06:17,370 --> 00:06:23,910
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> but the organs in the organism is</font>
