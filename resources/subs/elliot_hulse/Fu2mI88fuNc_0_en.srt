00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,928
so<font color="#CCCCCC"> sometimes people</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> ask me Elliot why do</font>

2
00:00:01,800 --> 00:00:05,490
you like<font color="#E5E5E5"> Ron Paul so much very first</font>

3
00:00:03,928 --> 00:00:08,308
things you got recognizes that it's not

4
00:00:05,490 --> 00:00:10,259
ron paul that<font color="#E5E5E5"> i love as much as it is</font>

5
00:00:08,308 --> 00:00:12,539
the idea of freedom and liberty freedom

6
00:00:10,259 --> 00:00:14,339
and liberty is what<font color="#CCCCCC"> i am</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> attached to and</font>

7
00:00:12,539 --> 00:00:16,799
in love<font color="#E5E5E5"> with ron paul just happens to be</font>

8
00:00:14,339 --> 00:00:19,410
the bird that's currently singing that

9
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:20,880
song at the<font color="#E5E5E5"> forefront whatever bird</font>

10
00:00:19,410 --> 00:00:22,800
sings that song it's a beautiful song

11
00:00:20,879 --> 00:00:24,868
and I'll be attached<font color="#E5E5E5"> to it I think most</font>

12
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:26,490
Americans if you ask<font color="#E5E5E5"> them do you love</font>

13
00:00:24,868 --> 00:00:29,969
Liberty do you love freedom they're

14
00:00:26,489 --> 00:00:32,039
<font color="#E5E5E5">going to say yes right well I'm not so</font>

15
00:00:29,969 --> 00:00:33,659
sure that's always true and i think that

16
00:00:32,039 --> 00:00:37,469
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> definition of liberty and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> freedom</font>

17
00:00:33,659 --> 00:00:39,419
has been sort of miscommunicated and

18
00:00:37,469 --> 00:00:43,079
confused so I made this short video for

19
00:00:39,420 --> 00:00:45,539
<font color="#E5E5E5">you just to ask questions in three basic</font>

20
00:00:43,079 --> 00:00:48,058
areas like broad areas that you can ask

21
00:00:45,539 --> 00:00:51,420
yourself to<font color="#E5E5E5"> find out if you love freedom</font>

22
00:00:48,058 --> 00:00:53,968
and liberty or not and it is just<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

23
00:00:51,420 --> 00:00:56,219
black and<font color="#CCCCCC"> white there's no half pregnant</font>

24
00:00:53,969 --> 00:00:58,109
on this you either love the idea of

25
00:00:56,219 --> 00:01:01,260
civil rights for everyone in<font color="#CCCCCC"> every</font>

26
00:00:58,109 --> 00:01:03,000
capacity or you don't there's no I like

27
00:01:01,259 --> 00:01:04,469
these rights but not those rights it's

28
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,819
one or the other so there are three

29
00:01:04,469 --> 00:01:09,000
areas that we're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to discuss and</font>

30
00:01:05,819 --> 00:01:10,649
you ask yourself yes or no on these

31
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:13,859
topics it's not<font color="#E5E5E5"> about being</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> right or</font>

32
00:01:10,650 --> 00:01:16,049
wrong okay if you choose not to love

33
00:01:13,859 --> 00:01:18,390
<font color="#CCCCCC">Liberty that's fine that's your personal</font>

34
00:01:16,049 --> 00:01:20,280
philosophy that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay i'm not here to</font>

35
00:01:18,390 --> 00:01:22,379
tell you that you're a bad person the

36
00:01:20,280 --> 00:01:23,939
point is you can't go around saying<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

37
00:01:22,379 --> 00:01:25,829
you love<font color="#E5E5E5"> Liberty if you want to take</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font>

38
00:01:23,938 --> 00:01:28,798
away<font color="#CCCCCC"> from someone else the three general</font>

39
00:01:25,829 --> 00:01:31,408
areas are civil rights monetary policy

40
00:01:28,799 --> 00:01:33,390
and foreign policy as far as civil

41
00:01:31,409 --> 00:01:36,180
rights is concerned if I want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to keep my</font>

42
00:01:33,390 --> 00:01:37,799
guns I should not infringe upon the

43
00:01:36,180 --> 00:01:40,200
right of someone else to marry who they

44
00:01:37,799 --> 00:01:42,868
want to marry I should<font color="#E5E5E5"> be able to do</font>

45
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:44,430
what I like to do with my life and not

46
00:01:42,868 --> 00:01:46,950
infringe upon the rights of someone else

47
00:01:44,430 --> 00:01:48,840
so if you want to marry<font color="#E5E5E5"> a man marrying a</font>

48
00:01:46,950 --> 00:01:50,570
man or a man marrying a goat I really

49
00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:53,759
<font color="#E5E5E5">don't care as long as you're just not</font>

50
00:01:50,569 --> 00:01:56,459
interfering with me or anyone<font color="#CCCCCC"> else</font>

51
00:01:53,759 --> 00:01:59,750
you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> not causing harm to anyone that's</font>

52
00:01:56,459 --> 00:02:02,639
a whole point and on the flip<font color="#CCCCCC"> side</font>

53
00:01:59,750 --> 00:02:04,978
anyone on on one<font color="#CCCCCC"> end of the spectrum</font>

54
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:07,978
shouldn't interfere with my or someone

55
00:02:04,978 --> 00:02:10,110
else's ability and freedom to do what

56
00:02:07,978 --> 00:02:11,539
they want when you value civil liberties

57
00:02:10,110 --> 00:02:13,640
it essentially means

58
00:02:11,539 --> 00:02:16,578
you leave everyone else alone to do what

59
00:02:13,639 --> 00:02:17,958
they want to do right so you're the love

60
00:02:16,579 --> 00:02:20,510
freedom where you don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> in that regard</font>

61
00:02:17,959 --> 00:02:22,250
then its monetary policy so everyone's

62
00:02:20,509 --> 00:02:24,289
been worried<font color="#CCCCCC"> about the economy</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and we've</font>

63
00:02:22,250 --> 00:02:27,250
got these<font color="#E5E5E5"> inflation's and these</font>

64
00:02:24,289 --> 00:02:29,840
deflation we're basically experiencing

65
00:02:27,250 --> 00:02:31,729
inflation that's causing all the gas

66
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:33,680
prices to go up I mean a gallon of milk

67
00:02:31,729 --> 00:02:35,539
is going<font color="#E5E5E5"> up everything is going up in</font>

68
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:37,879
<font color="#CCCCCC">price</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and it's mainly because the</font>

69
00:02:35,539 --> 00:02:41,479
government's intervention in our

70
00:02:37,878 --> 00:02:43,370
monetary policy or a monetary policy

71
00:02:41,479 --> 00:02:45,530
that's just not sound in<font color="#CCCCCC"> my opinion</font>

72
00:02:43,370 --> 00:02:48,739
which is one of intervention essentially

73
00:02:45,530 --> 00:02:49,549
the printing of more money like<font color="#E5E5E5"> you when</font>

74
00:02:48,739 --> 00:02:52,489
you were a kid and you had baseball

75
00:02:49,549 --> 00:02:54,139
cards if there were<font color="#CCCCCC"> just a handful of a</font>

76
00:02:52,489 --> 00:02:57,349
particular player the value of that

77
00:02:54,139 --> 00:02:59,060
player was high right but if there<font color="#CCCCCC"> were</font>

78
00:02:57,348 --> 00:03:01,518
tens of thousands or hundreds of

79
00:02:59,060 --> 00:03:02,810
thousands printed of that card the<font color="#E5E5E5"> value</font>

80
00:03:01,519 --> 00:03:05,389
<font color="#CCCCCC">goes down the same thing is happening</font>

81
00:03:02,810 --> 00:03:07,280
with our money that's why things are

82
00:03:05,389 --> 00:03:09,260
costing so much<font color="#E5E5E5"> I went to the store the</font>

83
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:11,209
other day and an orange cost me a dollar

84
00:03:09,259 --> 00:03:13,848
and I live in Florida it doesn't make

85
00:03:11,209 --> 00:03:15,289
any<font color="#E5E5E5"> sense so you either believe the</font>

86
00:03:13,848 --> 00:03:18,888
government should get<font color="#E5E5E5"> involved with how</font>

87
00:03:15,289 --> 00:03:20,418
<font color="#E5E5E5">money is created and how its distributed</font>

88
00:03:18,889 --> 00:03:22,430
which is another very important<font color="#E5E5E5"> point</font>

89
00:03:20,419 --> 00:03:24,829
should<font color="#E5E5E5"> the government be she taking</font>

90
00:03:22,430 --> 00:03:27,590
money away from one person to<font color="#CCCCCC"> give it to</font>

91
00:03:24,829 --> 00:03:29,780
another taking money from one person and

92
00:03:27,590 --> 00:03:31,848
giving it to the others the same it's

93
00:03:29,780 --> 00:03:33,949
just<font color="#E5E5E5"> like stealing doesn't matter who</font>

94
00:03:31,848 --> 00:03:35,750
has it or if you like that person or if

95
00:03:33,949 --> 00:03:38,260
they're in a part of the socio-economic

96
00:03:35,750 --> 00:03:41,000
<font color="#E5E5E5">ladder that is that you don't like</font>

97
00:03:38,259 --> 00:03:42,918
there's you can't take something from

98
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:44,060
someone that they rightfully earned and

99
00:03:42,919 --> 00:03:46,010
I'm not talking<font color="#CCCCCC"> about the one percent</font>

100
00:03:44,060 --> 00:03:48,590
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know the people who are creating</font>

101
00:03:46,009 --> 00:03:50,870
these policies of these unfair policies

102
00:03:48,590 --> 00:03:53,479
I'm talking about your general

103
00:03:50,870 --> 00:03:54,799
entrepreneur and job creator right you

104
00:03:53,479 --> 00:03:56,930
can't take something from him and give

105
00:03:54,799 --> 00:03:58,909
it<font color="#E5E5E5"> to someone else and believe in</font>

106
00:03:56,930 --> 00:04:01,519
freedom now you may<font color="#E5E5E5"> think that's okay</font>

107
00:03:58,908 --> 00:04:04,009
<font color="#CCCCCC">and that's fine you should</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> think that</font>

108
00:04:01,519 --> 00:04:05,840
<font color="#E5E5E5">there's wealth distribution with</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> regard</font>

109
00:04:04,009 --> 00:04:06,978
<font color="#CCCCCC">to monetary policy and at the government</font>

110
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:08,479
should keep printing money that's if

111
00:04:06,979 --> 00:04:10,699
<font color="#E5E5E5">that's your deal then that's fine just</font>

112
00:04:08,479 --> 00:04:12,319
don't go around<font color="#E5E5E5"> saying that you love</font>

113
00:04:10,699 --> 00:04:13,969
<font color="#CCCCCC">liberty or you love freedom because</font>

114
00:04:12,318 --> 00:04:16,098
that's not freedom that's not<font color="#CCCCCC"> Liberty</font>

115
00:04:13,969 --> 00:04:18,829
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay it's not right or wrong and then</font>

116
00:04:16,098 --> 00:04:20,839
foreign policy is the same idea do we

117
00:04:18,829 --> 00:04:22,579
now be very<font color="#E5E5E5"> clear that there's a</font>

118
00:04:20,839 --> 00:04:23,869
difference between defense defending

119
00:04:22,579 --> 00:04:26,629
yourself and

120
00:04:23,870 --> 00:04:28,819
sending yourself towards others<font color="#CCCCCC"> and they</font>

121

give<font color="#E5E5E5"> it whatever name you'd like it's a</font>

123

crusade of<font color="#E5E5E5"> sorts to spread democracy in</font>

124
00:04:33,589 --> 00:04:37,219
the same way that<font color="#E5E5E5"> the Crusades spread</font>

125
00:04:35,509 --> 00:04:39,228
Christianity whether you think<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's</font>

126
00:04:37,220 --> 00:04:41,630
right or wrong to spread this idea of

127
00:04:39,228 --> 00:04:43,519
democracy by infringing upon the

128
00:04:41,629 --> 00:04:46,399
livelihood of other people getting

129
00:04:43,519 --> 00:04:49,668
involved in wars that that really don't

130
00:04:46,399 --> 00:04:52,728
have any<font color="#E5E5E5"> impact on our safety at home</font>

131
00:04:49,668 --> 00:04:55,490
and let it<font color="#E5E5E5"> be clear we are very safe at</font>

132
00:04:52,728 --> 00:04:58,490
home our<font color="#E5E5E5"> defense is good but do you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> feel</font>

133
00:04:55,490 --> 00:05:01,579
<font color="#E5E5E5">as if that yes the America should go and</font>

134
00:04:58,490 --> 00:05:04,069
extend itself into<font color="#CCCCCC"> the affairs of other</font>

135
00:05:01,579 --> 00:05:07,519
nations<font color="#E5E5E5"> namely what's going on with with</font>

136
00:05:04,069 --> 00:05:09,079
Iran and Israel that's a big one why are

137
00:05:07,519 --> 00:05:11,599
we there do you believe we<font color="#E5E5E5"> really belong</font>

138
00:05:09,079 --> 00:05:14,418
there then that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> fine that's what your</font>

139
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:16,129
deal is just don't say you love freedom

140
00:05:14,418 --> 00:05:18,519
and liberty because it's not the same

141
00:05:16,129 --> 00:05:20,810
<font color="#CCCCCC">thing freedom and liberty means</font>

142
00:05:18,519 --> 00:05:22,279
non-intervention essentially means no

143
00:05:20,810 --> 00:05:23,990
one's going to tell you what<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do and</font>

144
