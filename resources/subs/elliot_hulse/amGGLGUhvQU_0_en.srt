25
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:11,129
guess well<font color="#CCCCCC"> I own the gym and I trained</font>

26
00:01:09,299 --> 00:01:13,950
athletes and did some boot camps and

27
00:01:11,129 --> 00:01:17,280
stuff and that was about<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> year after</font>

28
00:01:13,950 --> 00:01:19,618
YouTube came about and I figured it a

29
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:22,590
good way<font color="#E5E5E5"> to bring more clients in would</font>

30
00:01:19,618 --> 00:01:23,849
be to film some of the workouts so I put

00:01:22,590 --> 00:01:25,770
up my camera and<font color="#E5E5E5"> film some of the</font>

stuff like that<font color="#E5E5E5"> but also when you start</font>

50
00:02:09,449 --> 00:02:15,179
to answer those questions people<font color="#E5E5E5"> will</font>

51
00:02:13,289 --> 00:02:17,370
ask you questions about like what do<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

57
00:02:25,530 --> 00:02:31,620
offer some ideas so I created a sent a

58
00:02:28,378 --> 00:02:33,239
separate channel where I just offer then

59
00:02:31,620 --> 00:02:35,310
and I<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't have the right answers nor</font>

60
00:02:33,239 --> 00:02:37,230
do I ever claim to but just offer

61
00:02:35,310 --> 00:02:41,128
insights ideas that might be resourceful

62
00:02:37,229 --> 00:02:42,688
for mainly young men to navigate their

63
00:02:41,128 --> 00:02:44,878
life and become<font color="#E5E5E5"> what i call the</font>

64
00:02:42,688 --> 00:02:46,590
strongest version of themselves so it

65
00:02:44,878 --> 00:02:48,810
goes beyond just building a bigger

66
00:02:46,590 --> 00:02:50,848
stronger body but having the character

67
00:02:48,810 --> 00:02:52,199
associated with living a magnificent

68
00:02:50,848 --> 00:02:54,119
life in all regards you actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> just</font>

69
00:02:52,199 --> 00:02:56,188
did a recent<font color="#E5E5E5"> one i</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> think i saw where it</font>

70
00:02:54,120 --> 00:02:57,480
was like everything out there you have

71
00:02:56,188 --> 00:02:58,979
<font color="#CCCCCC">all the answers within yourself</font>

72
00:02:57,479 --> 00:03:01,578
everything<font color="#CCCCCC"> out there any resources just</font>

73
00:02:58,979 --> 00:03:05,039
pointing you to look at what you already

74
00:03:01,579 --> 00:03:06,480
what you already know yeah<font color="#CCCCCC"> i think</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> one</font>

75
00:03:05,039 --> 00:03:09,150
of the biggest there are<font color="#E5E5E5"> some core</font>

76
00:03:06,479 --> 00:03:12,768
issues that that<font color="#E5E5E5"> seem to come up and a</font>

77
00:03:09,150 --> 00:03:15,419
lot of them can be found in just basic

78
00:03:12,769 --> 00:03:17,459
character illogical issues if one of

79
00:03:15,419 --> 00:03:20,159
them is not trusting yourself<font color="#E5E5E5"> i noticed</font>

80
00:03:17,459 --> 00:03:21,628
<font color="#CCCCCC">that a lot of the questions the content</font>

81
00:03:20,158 --> 00:03:23,250
that the content is not<font color="#E5E5E5"> nearly as</font>

82
00:03:21,628 --> 00:03:24,598
important as the context where are you

83
00:03:23,250 --> 00:03:25,979
coming from what this<font color="#E5E5E5"> question is always</font>

84
00:03:24,598 --> 00:03:28,018
what I want to ask<font color="#CCCCCC"> I always</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> want to like</font>

85
00:03:25,979 --> 00:03:29,849
<font color="#E5E5E5">know okay so you're</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> asking this question</font>

86
00:03:28,019 --> 00:03:32,010
<font color="#E5E5E5">about your you know your girlfriend</font>

87
00:03:29,848 --> 00:03:34,500
looks like why do you need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to ask me</font>

88
00:03:32,009 --> 00:03:36,628
<font color="#CCCCCC">that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> question because apparently the</font>

89
00:03:34,500 --> 00:03:38,310
answer is pretty obvious and it's

90
00:03:36,628 --> 00:03:40,590
<font color="#E5E5E5">because we don't trust ourselves we've</font>

91
00:03:38,310 --> 00:03:43,079
been taught to like look for an expert

92
00:03:40,590 --> 00:03:45,509
or<font color="#E5E5E5"> teacher</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> or a parent or some sort of</font>

93
00:03:43,079 --> 00:03:48,150
patriarchal figure to grant us

94
00:03:45,509 --> 00:03:50,818
permission to be who we want to be so it

95
00:03:48,150 --> 00:03:53,219
I'm often reiterating in fact that you

96
00:03:50,818 --> 00:03:54,869
guys are powerful you're strong you're

97
00:03:53,219 --> 00:03:56,430
already strong version<font color="#E5E5E5"> of yourself you</font>

98
00:03:54,870 --> 00:03:58,769
<font color="#E5E5E5">just got to get out of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> your own way and</font>

99
00:03:56,430 --> 00:04:00,030
trust yourself strength three leagues

100
00:03:58,769 --> 00:04:02,188
that's what you kind<font color="#CCCCCC"> of your whole</font>

101
00:04:00,030 --> 00:04:04,229
message is<font color="#E5E5E5"> not just in strength training</font>

102
00:04:02,188 --> 00:04:05,818
in your<font color="#E5E5E5"> body but in all of your life</font>

103
00:04:04,229 --> 00:04:09,060
being the strongest version of yourself

104
00:04:05,818 --> 00:04:14,098
what is that<font color="#E5E5E5"> really and what how to tell</font>

105
00:04:09,060 --> 00:04:16,079
somebody cultivate that well about three

106
00:04:14,098 --> 00:04:17,848
four years ago I got<font color="#E5E5E5"> involved in a sport</font>

107
00:04:16,079 --> 00:04:19,379
of strong man so if anybody is not

108
00:04:17,848 --> 00:04:21,389
familiar<font color="#CCCCCC"> with that that's like if you</font>

109
00:04:19,379 --> 00:04:24,449
ever watched ESPN on my Christmas at

110
00:04:21,389 --> 00:04:26,879
midnight<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> see the giant men flipping</font>

111
00:04:24,449 --> 00:04:30,509
tractor tires and picking up

112
00:04:26,879 --> 00:04:33,240
big cement stones and pulling trucks so

113
00:04:30,509 --> 00:04:36,209
it's a really off the wall crazy sport

114
00:04:33,240 --> 00:04:37,800
<font color="#E5E5E5">designed to express her strength and I</font>

115
00:04:36,209 --> 00:04:40,229
got<font color="#E5E5E5"> addicted to it I started doing I was</font>

116
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:43,560
really good I was winning and I was

117
00:04:40,230 --> 00:04:46,980
slated to be the strongest in America at

118
00:04:43,560 --> 00:04:49,259
my weight class and I injured myself

119
00:04:46,980 --> 00:04:52,770
just a few weeks before<font color="#E5E5E5"> going into that</font>

120
00:04:49,259 --> 00:04:56,159
contest and the minute that my bikes

121
00:04:52,769 --> 00:04:58,859
that popped I knew that<font color="#CCCCCC"> it was</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> time for</font>

122
00:04:56,160 --> 00:05:01,080
<font color="#CCCCCC">a new version</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of myself to be born</font>

123
00:04:58,860 --> 00:05:03,060
because I realized<font color="#E5E5E5"> how imbalance my life</font>

124
00:05:01,079 --> 00:05:05,189
had become because of this obsession

125
00:05:03,060 --> 00:05:08,730
with building more muscle getting

126
00:05:05,189 --> 00:05:11,790
stronger achieving more and you know my

127
00:05:08,730 --> 00:05:14,040
story is a metaphor<font color="#E5E5E5"> for how we all tend</font>

128
00:05:11,790 --> 00:05:16,470
to go about our lives it's more bigger

129
00:05:14,040 --> 00:05:17,850
better more successful more money

130
00:05:16,470 --> 00:05:20,400
whatever the case may be for me it was

131
00:05:17,850 --> 00:05:24,240
<font color="#CCCCCC">just a bigger stronger body that wins at</font>

132
00:05:20,399 --> 00:05:26,699
flipping tires and when I popped my

133
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:28,319
bicep it was almost<font color="#E5E5E5"> like when in the old</font>

134
00:05:26,699 --> 00:05:30,029
cowboy movies when a horse breaks his

135
00:05:28,319 --> 00:05:32,879
leg you literally have<font color="#E5E5E5"> to take the gun</font>

136
00:05:30,029 --> 00:05:36,899
put him out of his misery and I went

137
00:05:32,879 --> 00:05:39,180
<font color="#E5E5E5">through a period of pain associated with</font>

138
00:05:36,899 --> 00:05:40,620
killing that character and and and if

139
00:05:39,180 --> 00:05:43,620
you're familiar<font color="#E5E5E5"> with like what a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Phoenix</font>

140
00:05:40,620 --> 00:05:47,160
does<font color="#E5E5E5"> burns and then</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Rises I think we all</font>

141
00:05:43,620 --> 00:05:50,850
have the capacity to be born again right

142
00:05:47,160 --> 00:05:52,500
and that's also a very difficult thing

143
00:05:50,850 --> 00:05:55,200
to do so I literally had to kill one

144
00:05:52,500 --> 00:05:58,910
character<font color="#CCCCCC"> to be born again and I was</font>

146
00:05:58,910 --> 00:06:05,850
formulated this over the<font color="#CCCCCC"> years that</font>

147
00:06:01,560 --> 00:06:07,649
strength is found in four layers<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay</font>

148
00:06:05,850 --> 00:06:09,540
but I call the four layers of strengthen

149
00:06:07,649 --> 00:06:11,219
these four layers all contribute to you

150
00:06:09,540 --> 00:06:14,460
becoming a strongest version yourself

151
00:06:11,220 --> 00:06:17,130
and the first and most superficial it's

152
00:06:14,459 --> 00:06:18,839
really<font color="#E5E5E5"> the outer layer of our strength</font>

153
00:06:17,129 --> 00:06:20,100
is what's what's happening here you know

154
00:06:18,839 --> 00:06:21,719
we do you want to lose<font color="#CCCCCC"> weight you want</font>

155
00:06:20,100 --> 00:06:24,150
to gain weight do you<font color="#E5E5E5"> want what I</font>

156
00:06:21,720 --> 00:06:27,000
typically invite people do is to improve

157
00:06:24,149 --> 00:06:28,709
<font color="#CCCCCC">your posture how are</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you carrying your</font>

158
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:32,550
body I pull that normal muscular

159
00:06:28,709 --> 00:06:34,409
strength our body is a physical

160
00:06:32,550 --> 00:06:38,129
manifestation of what's happening at the

161
00:06:34,410 --> 00:06:40,140
<font color="#E5E5E5">far deeper levels so one level deeper</font>

162
00:06:38,129 --> 00:06:40,469
than the physical manifestation you know

163
00:06:40,139 --> 00:06:42,209
how

164
00:06:40,470 --> 00:06:45,140
carrying yourself the look in your eye

165
00:06:42,209 --> 00:06:48,149
the glimmer in your smile is a

166
00:06:45,139 --> 00:06:50,519
expression of the second layer which is

167
00:06:48,149 --> 00:06:52,349
<font color="#E5E5E5">our physiological strength physiological</font>

168
00:06:50,519 --> 00:06:53,639
strength is basically how well you are

169
00:06:52,350 --> 00:06:56,100
taking<font color="#CCCCCC"> care of your digestive system</font>

170
00:06:53,639 --> 00:06:57,560
your endocrine system your hormones and

171
00:06:56,100 --> 00:07:00,030
things that<font color="#E5E5E5"> are happening internally</font>

172
00:06:57,560 --> 00:07:01,620
these are the internal systems of the

173
00:07:00,029 --> 00:07:04,529
body that<font color="#E5E5E5"> need to be considered you know</font>

174
00:07:01,620 --> 00:07:06,750
<font color="#E5E5E5">you can work yourself to the bone but if</font>

175
00:07:04,529 --> 00:07:08,579
you're you're eating poorly not in the

176
00:07:06,750 --> 00:07:10,829
bodybuilding sense of eating poorly like

177
00:07:08,579 --> 00:07:12,269
you know how to<font color="#E5E5E5"> gain weight</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> or lose</font>

178
00:07:10,829 --> 00:07:16,199
weight but if you're just<font color="#E5E5E5"> feeling your</font>

179
00:07:12,269 --> 00:07:18,750
body with poor quality<font color="#E5E5E5"> food right things</font>

180
00:07:16,199 --> 00:07:20,729
that detract from your energy then

181
00:07:18,750 --> 00:07:24,389
you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> never really going to become</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

182
00:07:20,730 --> 00:07:26,520
<font color="#E5E5E5">strongest versions one step below that I</font>

183
00:07:24,389 --> 00:07:28,979
use a chart below but it's almost<font color="#E5E5E5"> like</font>

184
00:07:26,519 --> 00:07:31,019
one step above that is energetic

185
00:07:28,980 --> 00:07:32,520
strength<font color="#CCCCCC"> alright really the one that</font>

186
00:07:31,019 --> 00:07:34,439
matters more than anything it's what's

187
00:07:32,519 --> 00:07:37,699
happening here what's happening here

188
00:07:34,439 --> 00:07:40,649
what's happening at a at a root

189
00:07:37,699 --> 00:07:41,849
psychological emotional level you know

190
00:07:40,649 --> 00:07:43,649
if you're if you're if you're mentally

191
00:07:41,850 --> 00:07:47,060
in a boat if you're mentally stressed

192
00:07:43,649 --> 00:07:49,259
it's going to manifest<font color="#CCCCCC"> itself physically</font>

193
00:07:47,060 --> 00:07:51,560
physiologically because your hormones

194
00:07:49,259 --> 00:07:54,629
will be<font color="#E5E5E5"> off too much cortisol adrenaline</font>

195
00:07:51,560 --> 00:07:56,100
your be burnt out<font color="#CCCCCC"> and I've stage</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> three</font>

196
00:07:54,629 --> 00:07:58,529
adrenal fatigue you're going to be a

197
00:07:56,100 --> 00:07:59,850
mess and if you got adrenal fatigue

198
00:07:58,529 --> 00:08:02,219
there's no way that you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to be</font>

199
00:07:59,850 --> 00:08:03,810
burning fat in the gym so we've got to

200
00:08:02,220 --> 00:08:05,400
consider what what's<font color="#E5E5E5"> happening here what</font>

201
00:08:03,810 --> 00:08:07,290
<font color="#CCCCCC">is your life like how are you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> thinking</font>

202
00:08:05,399 --> 00:08:09,870
<font color="#CCCCCC">about your circumstances and then</font>

203
00:08:07,290 --> 00:08:12,240
finally the fourth layer is what are you

204
00:08:09,870 --> 00:08:15,810
going to do now because<font color="#E5E5E5"> really all this</font>

205
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:18,660
growing stronger can could be kute can

206
00:08:15,810 --> 00:08:20,790
become a bit narcissistic if we don't

207
00:08:18,660 --> 00:08:22,919
realize<font color="#E5E5E5"> that well you're going to die</font>

208
00:08:20,790 --> 00:08:25,020
and how many<font color="#E5E5E5"> people are you helping</font>

209
00:08:22,918 --> 00:08:27,000
along the way and I follow that

210
00:08:25,019 --> 00:08:29,039
presentable strength because it's a play

211
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:32,759
on words because it's how we offer

212
00:08:29,040 --> 00:08:34,769
ourselves as a stronger version as a

213
00:08:32,759 --> 00:08:38,668
present to<font color="#CCCCCC"> the world how are you serving</font>

214
00:08:34,769 --> 00:08:40,769
others and and presentable in the same

215
00:08:38,668 --> 00:08:43,889
way well how do people perceiving you

216
00:08:40,769 --> 00:08:47,039
because<font color="#E5E5E5"> they're make no bones about it</font>

217
00:08:43,889 --> 00:08:49,620
the way you offer yourself to the world

218
00:08:47,039 --> 00:08:51,549
will always you always get a mirror

219
00:08:49,620 --> 00:08:54,250
reflection mm-hmm

220
00:08:51,549 --> 00:08:56,439
hmm so<font color="#E5E5E5"> really it's going out it's going</font>

221
00:08:54,250 --> 00:08:57,940
out and serving others right why do you

222
00:08:56,440 --> 00:08:59,800
<font color="#E5E5E5">think you just said about being reborn</font>

223
00:08:57,940 --> 00:09:01,750
constantly like dying you should that

224
00:08:59,799 --> 00:09:03,939
example<font color="#E5E5E5"> in your own life like dying to</font>

225
00:09:01,750 --> 00:09:06,700
reborn rebirth the new<font color="#CCCCCC"> version of your</font>

226
00:09:03,940 --> 00:09:09,220
sub why are people so afraid of<font color="#E5E5E5"> dying</font>

227
00:09:06,700 --> 00:09:11,050
it's almost like we're so attached not

228
00:09:09,220 --> 00:09:13,089
dying like literally dying but dying

229
00:09:11,049 --> 00:09:15,729
like we can die daily right and like be

230
00:09:13,089 --> 00:09:18,100
reborn and born anew every day and it's

231
00:09:15,730 --> 00:09:20,259
just like we're so afraid and attached

232
00:09:18,100 --> 00:09:22,500
<font color="#E5E5E5">to that attached or afraid of letting a</font>

233
00:09:20,259 --> 00:09:24,700
goal it's like wires that come from

234
00:09:22,500 --> 00:09:29,139
because the natural process isn't it to

235
00:09:24,700 --> 00:09:31,870
just be like it's a constant but yeah

236
00:09:29,139 --> 00:09:35,620
yeah we become personally identified

237
00:09:31,870 --> 00:09:37,509
with with who we've been told we are and

238
00:09:35,620 --> 00:09:39,789
I think<font color="#CCCCCC"> that's what it stems from I</font>

239
00:09:37,509 --> 00:09:43,240
think it stems from living<font color="#E5E5E5"> in a world</font>

240
00:09:39,789 --> 00:09:45,458
where everyone wants concreteness they

241
00:09:43,240 --> 00:09:48,730
want to know they want to know your

242
00:09:45,458 --> 00:09:50,768
<font color="#CCCCCC">katarina and you got long hair and this</font>

243
00:09:48,730 --> 00:09:52,570
is what you're like good i got shit

244
00:09:50,769 --> 00:09:54,720
perfect you the box you know we<font color="#E5E5E5"> live</font>

245
00:09:52,570 --> 00:09:57,278
this in<font color="#E5E5E5"> this really reductionistic</font>

246
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:59,139
science has afforded us so much because

247
00:09:57,278 --> 00:10:02,919
<font color="#CCCCCC">of our ability to reduce</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> into pieces</font>

248
00:09:59,139 --> 00:10:04,269
<font color="#CCCCCC">right now we've got atomic science and</font>

249
00:10:02,919 --> 00:10:05,889
you know if you go dig even deeper

250
00:10:04,269 --> 00:10:07,720
you've got quantum science where now

251
00:10:05,889 --> 00:10:10,689
it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> like okay shit we don't know</font>

252
00:10:07,720 --> 00:10:12,850
anything we've been able to<font color="#E5E5E5"> reduce</font>

253
00:10:10,690 --> 00:10:14,620
things down<font color="#CCCCCC"> to such an ability to such a</font>

254
00:10:12,850 --> 00:10:16,659
degree that we we can manipulate our

255
00:10:14,620 --> 00:10:18,009
environment it has afforded us the world

256
00:10:16,659 --> 00:10:20,019
<font color="#E5E5E5">that we live in it's given us the</font>

257
00:10:18,009 --> 00:10:22,899
opportunity to<font color="#E5E5E5"> speak as we are from</font>

258
00:10:20,019 --> 00:10:24,610
across the world through bits right

259
00:10:22,899 --> 00:10:27,539
<font color="#E5E5E5">through the computers with the internet</font>

260
00:10:24,610 --> 00:10:30,669
fantastic it's wonderful the problem is

261
00:10:27,539 --> 00:10:34,088
human beings aren't that easy you can't

262
00:10:30,669 --> 00:10:35,740
break<font color="#E5E5E5"> us down but we in order to to</font>

263
00:10:34,089 --> 00:10:38,589
navigate the world in order to be able

264
00:10:35,740 --> 00:10:40,028
to deal with<font color="#CCCCCC"> people socially we start</font>

265
00:10:38,589 --> 00:10:41,829
creating categories for people we start

266
00:10:40,028 --> 00:10:44,019
trying<font color="#CCCCCC"> to break them down your of this</font>

267
00:10:41,828 --> 00:10:45,849
boom gotcha<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're this boom gotcha</font>

268
00:10:44,019 --> 00:10:47,708
that's I<font color="#E5E5E5"> mean it's really a form of</font>

269
00:10:45,850 --> 00:10:51,009
prejudice you know it might<font color="#CCCCCC"> not</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> be based</font>

270
00:10:47,708 --> 00:10:53,289
on color but it's based on boom I<font color="#E5E5E5"> got</font>

271
00:10:51,009 --> 00:10:55,208
you I<font color="#E5E5E5"> figured out that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> man who you are</font>

272
00:10:53,289 --> 00:10:57,338
right to make everyone<font color="#CCCCCC"> else very</font>

273
00:10:55,208 --> 00:10:59,859
uncomfortable when you<font color="#E5E5E5"> step outside the</font>

274
00:10:57,339 --> 00:11:01,570
box that they push you in you put<font color="#E5E5E5"> people</font>

275
00:10:59,860 --> 00:11:04,028
in boxes and the minute you step outside

276
00:11:01,570 --> 00:11:04,510
that box your mom goes that's not the

277
00:11:04,028 --> 00:11:06,580
<font color="#E5E5E5">Elliot</font>

278
00:11:04,509 --> 00:11:09,610
I know is everything<font color="#CCCCCC"> alright with</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

279

you're acting more like Bobby Orr you

280
00:11:09,610 --> 00:11:13,240
see what I'm saying like<font color="#E5E5E5"> that you know</font>

281
00:11:10,899 --> 00:11:15,759
<font color="#E5E5E5">you're not yourself what exactly</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> does</font>

282
00:11:13,240 --> 00:11:18,850
<font color="#CCCCCC">that mean I'm not myself it begins that</font>

283
00:11:15,759 --> 00:11:20,950
early where your<font color="#CCCCCC"> parents want</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to be able</font>

284
00:11:18,850 --> 00:11:22,570
to label you pinpoint you boom I gotcha

285
00:11:20,950 --> 00:11:24,460
and then you go<font color="#CCCCCC"> into school and people</font>

286
00:11:22,570 --> 00:11:27,100
figured you're a jock or you're a nerd

287
00:11:24,460 --> 00:11:29,350
or your this or your that but the minute

288

you step outside<font color="#E5E5E5"> of that what are you a</font>

289
00:11:29,350 --> 00:11:32,830

to be courageous enough to deal with

299
00:11:49,419 --> 00:11:54,879
other people's criticisms when we decide

300
00:11:52,600 --> 00:11:56,200
to change our mind when we decide to be

301
00:11:54,879 --> 00:11:58,689
born again we decide to do something

302

right just stop my life right it's that

312
00:12:19,259 --> 00:12:27,700
what you're also showing me how you're

313
00:12:25,539 --> 00:12:29,889
showing me that I'm responsible for<font color="#CCCCCC"> all</font>

314
00:12:27,700 --> 00:12:31,840
the dysfunction in my life how dare you

315
00:12:29,889 --> 00:12:34,210
go and change to become a better<font color="#E5E5E5"> version</font>

316
00:12:31,840 --> 00:12:36,190
of yourself show yourself because now it

317
00:12:34,210 --> 00:12:38,070
forces me to look at myself and I don't

318
00:12:36,190 --> 00:12:43,330
want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> look at myself you're a bastard</font>

319
00:12:38,070 --> 00:12:45,640
mm-hmm that is so I mean it's like we're

320
00:12:43,330 --> 00:12:47,139
just we are this energy this vibration

321
00:12:45,639 --> 00:12:49,360
and we're constantly flowing and moving

322
00:12:47,139 --> 00:12:52,629
if we allow ourselves to write if we're

323
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:54,669
not so tied to this idea<font color="#CCCCCC"> of ourselves or</font>

324
00:12:52,629 --> 00:12:57,519
idea of others but yeah I've noticed

325
00:12:54,669 --> 00:12:59,069
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> people are afraid of it's like it</font>

326
00:12:57,519 --> 00:13:01,539
does it kind of threatens their very

327

330
00:13:06,820 --> 00:13:10,120
recently with somebody and she was

331
00:13:08,529 --> 00:13:12,459
because I was selling her that I have

332
00:13:10,120 --> 00:13:14,019
the feeling that the the heart

333
00:13:12,460 --> 00:13:16,360
conviction I'm going to be moving to LA

334

340
00:13:26,539 --> 00:13:31,069
like because her friend moved to<font color="#E5E5E5"> LA now</font>

345
00:13:37,580 --> 00:13:43,280
that a bad thing yeah it's wonderful

347
00:13:43,279 --> 00:13:47,209
sitting here looking at trees outside

348
00:13:45,110 --> 00:13:48,620
and the trees are constantly changing

349
00:13:47,210 --> 00:13:51,560
<font color="#CCCCCC">the colors of the leaves are changing</font>

350
00:13:48,620 --> 00:13:52,909
the way it's growing is changing<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

351
00:13:51,559 --> 00:13:55,549
type of water that it's receiving

352
00:13:52,909 --> 00:13:57,829
changes its physiology and the way it

353
00:13:55,549 --> 00:14:00,219
expresses itself nature is constantly

354
00:13:57,830 --> 00:14:03,560
moving we're the<font color="#E5E5E5"> ones who have become</font>

355
00:14:00,220 --> 00:14:06,649
<font color="#E5E5E5">rooted in idea it's really right right</font>

356
00:14:03,559 --> 00:14:08,359
right exactly so one of the videos that

357
00:14:06,649 --> 00:14:09,799
you've done that I bet one of the first

358
00:14:08,360 --> 00:14:12,080
ones that<font color="#E5E5E5"> i saw that i absolutely love</font>

359
00:14:09,799 --> 00:14:14,179
was you talked about creating a non job

360
00:14:12,080 --> 00:14:16,160
resume and you went through this<font color="#CCCCCC"> whole</font>

361
00:14:14,179 --> 00:14:18,439
process and<font color="#E5E5E5"> i just thought it was so</font>

362
00:14:16,159 --> 00:14:20,929
brilliant about you said love something

364
00:14:20,929 --> 00:14:25,759
and you represent it in such a way that

365
00:14:23,149 --> 00:14:28,039
it's very simple and it is really<font color="#E5E5E5"> quite</font>

366
00:14:25,759 --> 00:14:30,139
simple right because it's it's so it's

367
00:14:28,039 --> 00:14:32,029
almost<font color="#E5E5E5"> like i could feel first of all</font>

368
00:14:30,139 --> 00:14:33,439
within myself but<font color="#E5E5E5"> i'm</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> sure</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> i could feel</font>

369
00:14:32,029 --> 00:14:35,120
it for others who would might be

370
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:37,340
watching<font color="#CCCCCC"> that or hearing something like</font>

371
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:39,470
that and go<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay well wait it's not that</font>

372
00:14:37,340 --> 00:14:41,240
easy you don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> like how do i</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> actually</font>

373
00:14:39,470 --> 00:14:42,620
implement this how do i actually do<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font>

374
00:14:41,240 --> 00:14:44,930
because probably<font color="#E5E5E5"> some people are saying</font>

375
00:14:42,620 --> 00:14:47,240
<font color="#E5E5E5">i am doing what i love but i'm not</font>

376
00:14:44,929 --> 00:14:49,339
receiving the money or I'm not receiving

377
00:14:47,240 --> 00:14:50,870
the love so can<font color="#CCCCCC"> you share</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a little bit</font>

378
00:14:49,340 --> 00:14:52,009
about that<font color="#CCCCCC"> and really bright you know</font>

379
00:14:50,870 --> 00:14:56,320
<font color="#CCCCCC">because this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is what you've sort of done</font>

380
00:14:52,009 --> 00:14:59,720
right in your own life yeah you know

381
00:14:56,320 --> 00:15:02,420
doing things is always easy especially

382
00:14:59,720 --> 00:15:05,149
when it's presented you know step one

383
00:15:02,419 --> 00:15:08,179
step two step three becoming someone

384
00:15:05,149 --> 00:15:10,250
different that's where the challenges so

385
00:15:08,179 --> 00:15:12,649
it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> much this is actually more</font>

386
00:15:10,250 --> 00:15:14,450
<font color="#E5E5E5">heart more difficult than it sounds it's</font>

387
00:15:12,649 --> 00:15:17,329
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay now you need</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to get out of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> your way</font>

388
00:15:14,450 --> 00:15:20,090
and allow<font color="#E5E5E5"> that to happen so that's why</font>

389
00:15:17,330 --> 00:15:22,190
it seems far more difficult than<font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font>

390
00:15:20,090 --> 00:15:25,399
really is now not a little wrong there

391
00:15:22,190 --> 00:15:28,460
is a process of Education there's a

392
00:15:25,399 --> 00:15:31,039
process of determination and discipline

393
00:15:28,460 --> 00:15:35,089
and consistency all we

394
00:15:31,039 --> 00:15:37,639

397
00:15:39,620 --> 00:15:43,578

400
00:15:45,799 --> 00:15:50,208
it's not<font color="#CCCCCC"> that this doesn't work that you</font>
