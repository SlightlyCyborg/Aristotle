1
00:00:02,658 --> 00:00:08,730
so a lot of people<font color="#E5E5E5"> find it strange and</font>

2
00:00:05,250 --> 00:00:12,330
even obnoxious that<font color="#E5E5E5"> Elliott Hulse refers</font>

3
00:00:08,730 --> 00:00:14,580
to himself as Elliott Hulse so what<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

4
00:00:12,330 --> 00:00:16,350
this about I feel like I owe you an

5
00:00:14,580 --> 00:00:19,589
explanation because I do it quite often

6
00:00:16,350 --> 00:00:24,689
and the associations with a practice

7
00:00:19,589 --> 00:00:26,550
like that are far more shallow than the

8
00:00:24,689 --> 00:00:29,250
place I'm coming from when I refer to

9
00:00:26,550 --> 00:00:31,649
<font color="#E5E5E5">Elliott Hulse so the very first thing</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

10
00:00:29,250 --> 00:00:35,609
want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to share with you is that there's a</font>

11
00:00:31,649 --> 00:00:38,519
core being beneath the facade of the

12
00:00:35,609 --> 00:00:40,799
characters we all play in life when I

13
00:00:38,520 --> 00:00:42,390
say character I do don't necessarily

14
00:00:40,799 --> 00:00:44,429
mean the yo<font color="#E5E5E5"> Elliott character that I</font>

15
00:00:42,390 --> 00:00:46,439
play when I'm you know doing my strength

16
00:00:44,429 --> 00:00:50,460
training videos or even you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

17
00:00:46,439 --> 00:00:53,420
character<font color="#CCCCCC"> that I am molding as I you</font>

18
00:00:50,460 --> 00:00:57,239
know move forward in my profession I

19
00:00:53,420 --> 00:00:59,579
mean the person we've<font color="#CCCCCC"> been told we are</font>

20
00:00:57,238 --> 00:01:01,500
that's attached<font color="#E5E5E5"> to the name we've been</font>

21
00:00:59,579 --> 00:01:03,420
given since the time we were children

22
00:01:01,500 --> 00:01:06,030
since the time your children you've been

23
00:01:03,420 --> 00:01:07,530
told what you should<font color="#CCCCCC"> be like what you</font>

24
00:01:06,030 --> 00:01:09,750
should do what's appropriate what's not

25
00:01:07,530 --> 00:01:12,329
appropriate which you should aspire to

26
00:01:09,750 --> 00:01:14,849
and then we build defenses psychological

27
00:01:12,329 --> 00:01:17,849
defenses against things that we find

28
00:01:14,849 --> 00:01:20,429
uncomfortable experiences that were

29
00:01:17,849 --> 00:01:22,559
traumatic also we find ways to move

30
00:01:20,430 --> 00:01:25,229
towards things<font color="#E5E5E5"> that are that feel good</font>

31
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:30,450
and these<font color="#CCCCCC"> are all</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> these old mold our</font>

32
00:01:25,228 --> 00:01:32,368
character they all mold who we play all

33
00:01:30,450 --> 00:01:36,450
<font color="#CCCCCC">of this is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> very superficial all of this</font>

34
00:01:32,368 --> 00:01:38,489
is layered on top of the core individual

35
00:01:36,450 --> 00:01:40,920
who you really are deep on the inside

36
00:01:38,489 --> 00:01:42,298
you know I even<font color="#E5E5E5"> I call that the</font>

strongest<font color="#E5E5E5"> version yourself the strongest</font>

38
00:01:42,299 --> 00:01:47,880
version yourself is a process of

39
00:01:45,239 --> 00:01:50,399
removing the layers especially the Unruh

40
00:01:47,879 --> 00:01:55,019
source<font color="#CCCCCC"> four layers of character build up</font>

41
00:01:50,399 --> 00:01:56,939
that deter you from be seeing the true

42
00:01:55,019 --> 00:02:02,699
essence the true being that that's deep

43
00:01:56,938 --> 00:02:06,508
<font color="#E5E5E5">within you so I formed a attitude of</font>

44
00:02:02,700 --> 00:02:07,829
detachment from Elliott Hulse so when I

45
00:02:06,509 --> 00:02:09,538
say Elliott Hulse i'm referring to

46
00:02:07,828 --> 00:02:11,250
<font color="#E5E5E5">Elliott Hulse and I say you know Elliot</font>

47
00:02:09,538 --> 00:02:12,818
hell's this all is that really what I'm

48
00:02:11,250 --> 00:02:16,120
referring to is this

49
00:02:12,818 --> 00:02:19,759
imaginary character in my mind and

50
00:02:16,120 --> 00:02:21,620
through which you receive me through

51
00:02:19,759 --> 00:02:24,289
what you experience me that i'm

52
00:02:21,620 --> 00:02:25,670
referring<font color="#E5E5E5"> to it's not me</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i'm not</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> elliott</font>

hulse<font color="#CCCCCC"> I've done a video about this I'm</font>

54
00:02:25,669 --> 00:02:29,780
my strength training channel where I

55
00:02:28,430 --> 00:02:32,329
call it<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm not elliott hulse and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm</font>

this I this essence this being this

60
00:02:42,310 --> 00:02:51,019
watcher that's experiencing this what's

61
00:02:47,299 --> 00:02:54,319
going on<font color="#E5E5E5"> the play of life is not Elliott</font>

62
00:02:51,019 --> 00:02:56,959
Hulse so I<font color="#E5E5E5"> want</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you to understand that</font>

63
00:02:54,318 --> 00:02:59,328
<font color="#E5E5E5">when I would I refer to this Elliot host</font>

64
00:02:56,959 --> 00:03:04,479
character it's not<font color="#E5E5E5"> from a narcissistic</font>

65
00:02:59,329 --> 00:03:06,980
place of placing putting myself above

66

someone or something else in a hierarchy

67
00:03:06,979 --> 00:03:12,789
whereby I need to refer to<font color="#E5E5E5"> myself as if</font>

68
00:03:10,068 --> 00:03:16,039
I there's some sort of kingship you know

69
00:03:12,789 --> 00:03:21,108
<font color="#E5E5E5">Elliott Hulse right it's not a position</font>

70
00:03:16,039 --> 00:03:23,598
<font color="#CCCCCC">of grandeur from which I refer to</font>

71
00:03:21,109 --> 00:03:27,290
<font color="#E5E5E5">Elliott Hulse it's a position of</font>

72
00:03:23,598 --> 00:03:32,078
detachment I am NOT Elliott Hulse and

73
00:03:27,289 --> 00:03:35,918
when I refer to<font color="#CCCCCC"> him it's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> simply that</font>

74
00:03:32,079 --> 00:03:35,919
character that you've come to know
