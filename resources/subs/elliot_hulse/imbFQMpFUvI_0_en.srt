00:00:13,230 --> 00:00:17,880
every action is measured by the

6
00:00:15,359 --> 00:00:20,250
sentiment of which it proceeds the most

7
00:00:17,879 --> 00:00:22,768

conviction about what you're offering

00:02:29,109 --> 00:02:33,430
the way with the future and its

56
00:02:30,759 --> 00:02:35,649
historical past you're still training in

57
00:02:33,430 --> 00:02:38,170
air-conditioned gyms with treadmills of

58
00:02:35,650 --> 00:02:40,030
such and such then there's something

00:02:43,780 --> 00:02:48,340
this is what they get is they train with

68
00:02:58,240 --> 00:03:01,240
that in yourself that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> something that</font>

69
00:02:59,740 --> 00:03:02,379
you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to have to practice then</font>

70
00:03:01,240 --> 00:03:04,870
you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> in it then you can never convince</font>

71
00:03:02,379 --> 00:03:06,490
yourself see what's right aboard it is

72
00:03:04,870 --> 00:03:09,730
we<font color="#CCCCCC"> think that like some people have</font>

73
00:03:06,490 --> 00:03:14,080
things you have this distrait gets

74
00:03:09,729 --> 00:03:16,060
character really<font color="#E5E5E5"> Oh hurry it was really</font>

75
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:19,630
<font color="#E5E5E5">good on these Alan boxes listening to</font>

76
00:03:16,060 --> 00:03:23,860
today<font color="#E5E5E5"> really everything is just a story</font>

77
00:03:19,629 --> 00:03:25,569
you're telling yourself all right right

78
00:03:23,860 --> 00:03:28,090
you're able to approach the world with a

79
00:03:25,569 --> 00:03:29,769
particular virtue but that virtue is

80
00:03:28,090 --> 00:03:31,769
only a manifestation of a story that

81
00:03:29,769 --> 00:03:35,560
you're telling yourself and we're all

82
00:03:31,769 --> 00:03:37,980
telling ourselves stories all<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

83
00:03:35,560 --> 00:03:40,539
clothes you<font color="#CCCCCC"> wear if you hang out with</font>

84
00:03:37,979 --> 00:03:42,639
everything about<font color="#E5E5E5"> how you want Maggie</font>

85
00:03:40,539 --> 00:03:44,560
life is a story you've told yourself

86
00:03:42,639 --> 00:03:47,799
someone has told you but bottom line

87
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:48,819
you've accepted so what I'm basically

88
00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:52,360
things you can have to brainwash

89
00:03:48,818 --> 00:03:54,369
yourself and your brain wash yourself

90
00:03:52,360 --> 00:03:59,560
just way everybody<font color="#CCCCCC"> else is brainwashing</font>

91
00:03:54,370 --> 00:04:01,599
you with repetition and passion look in

92
00:03:59,560 --> 00:04:03,189
the mirror that sounds crazy<font color="#E5E5E5"> I know but</font>

93
00:04:01,599 --> 00:04:04,859
look in the mirror<font color="#E5E5E5"> and you look at</font>

94
00:04:03,189 --> 00:04:07,629
yourself<font color="#E5E5E5"> and you say to yourself that</font>

95
00:04:04,860 --> 00:04:09,340
back your training is only training<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

96
00:04:07,629 --> 00:04:11,560
matters is the<font color="#E5E5E5"> training everyone should</font>

97
00:04:09,340 --> 00:04:13,599
do and I'm a maximum backyard training

98
00:04:11,560 --> 00:04:15,460
and a person to become cognitive

99
00:04:13,599 --> 00:04:17,050
dissonance

100
00:04:15,460 --> 00:04:19,300
I'm talking on my cell<font color="#E5E5E5"> phone is fucking</font>

101
00:04:17,050 --> 00:04:21,790
weird so there's the old type of

102
00:04:19,300 --> 00:04:23,680
resistance with that resistance is the

103
00:04:21,790 --> 00:04:27,040
same resistance that she experienced

104
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:28,980
when you open her about you're going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

105
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:31,240
feel it gently with a visceral level

106
00:04:28,980 --> 00:04:34,689
what happens when that resistance is

107
00:04:31,240 --> 00:04:37,060
broken a brand-new emergence get over

108
00:04:34,689 --> 00:04:40,329
this is cut the discomfort of the

109
00:04:37,060 --> 00:04:42,370
resistance and a<font color="#CCCCCC"> brand-new you emergency</font>

110
00:04:40,329 --> 00:04:45,849
you'll breathe deeper was there a step

111
00:04:42,370 --> 00:04:48,670
for you between in all the parts and

112
00:04:45,850 --> 00:04:52,240
stuff to wear your another<font color="#CCCCCC"> department</font>

113
00:04:48,670 --> 00:04:54,670
when<font color="#CCCCCC"> you're honest you is very easy to</font>

114
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:56,560
cultivate courage so I'm going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> give</font>

115
00:04:54,670 --> 00:05:00,449

116
00:04:56,560 --> 00:05:03,519
myself and it'll be cool be cool to hear

117
00:05:00,449 --> 00:05:04,990
whether the fact is that you're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

118
00:05:03,519 --> 00:05:06,459
experience something different what I'm

119

122
00:05:13,240 --> 00:05:18,460
<font color="#E5E5E5">this principle applies across the board</font>

123
00:05:15,819 --> 00:05:20,469
to everything it's conviction and

124
00:05:18,459 --> 00:05:24,399
courage<font color="#E5E5E5"> I trained to people I work with</font>

125
00:05:20,470 --> 00:05:27,010
my dad and and I realize I was getting

126
00:05:24,399 --> 00:05:30,099
sick and tired of literally<font color="#E5E5E5"> driving</font>

131
00:05:38,230 --> 00:05:42,340
anything else to drive and it didn't

132
00:05:40,089 --> 00:05:46,259
have windows I want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to refrain bringing</font>

165
00:07:11,848 --> 00:07:17,639
<font color="#E5E5E5">hey a number of things going to happen</font>

166
00:07:13,860 --> 00:07:20,788
number one you're going to be you're

167
00:07:17,639 --> 00:07:22,679
gonna practice courage you know I can do

168
00:07:20,788 --> 00:07:23,938
it and once you practice courage you can

169
00:07:22,678 --> 00:07:25,468
do it again<font color="#CCCCCC"> do it again do it again do</font>

170
00:07:23,939 --> 00:07:28,099
it again takes private case<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's</font>

171
00:07:25,468 --> 00:07:34,949
exercise you're exercising your courage

172
00:07:28,098 --> 00:07:37,498
number two it might fail that would be

173
00:07:34,949 --> 00:07:41,249
great if it fails because it's just

174
00:07:37,499 --> 00:07:43,649
<font color="#E5E5E5">discard one way it doesn't work be</font>

175
00:07:41,249 --> 00:07:47,399
prepared to fail I was<font color="#E5E5E5"> very prepared of</font>

176
00:07:43,649 --> 00:07:48,809
that I even<font color="#E5E5E5"> had a failure plan which is</font>

177
00:07:47,399 --> 00:07:50,519
like a<font color="#E5E5E5"> little weird because it's like</font>

178
00:07:48,809 --> 00:07:52,259
you know the whole idea failures you

179
00:07:50,519 --> 00:07:54,778
don't know what to have<font color="#E5E5E5"> plans with a</font>

180
00:07:52,259 --> 00:07:57,419
friend level plane or failures and my

181
00:07:54,778 --> 00:07:59,879
plan was oh yeah I'm not<font color="#E5E5E5"> going</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> back</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to a</font>

182
00:07:57,418 --> 00:08:01,528
job i live in florida<font color="#CCCCCC"> they're migrant</font>

183
00:07:59,879 --> 00:08:03,959
workers that they pay to take origins I

184
00:08:01,528 --> 00:08:07,228
can do<font color="#E5E5E5"> that because I was not going back</font>

185
00:08:03,959 --> 00:08:10,168
to make respect of the job picking

186
00:08:07,228 --> 00:08:12,088
oranges right so if you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> developing an</font>

187
00:08:10,168 --> 00:08:17,579
app to<font color="#CCCCCC"> the courage you've just</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> learned</font>

188
00:08:12,088 --> 00:08:20,069
how to don't work and that's essentially

189
00:08:17,579 --> 00:08:22,860
it is practicing your courage and being

190
00:08:20,069 --> 00:08:24,419
okay with failure because if you keep

191
00:08:22,860 --> 00:08:29,189
knocking on doors eventually what will

192
00:08:24,418 --> 00:08:31,338
