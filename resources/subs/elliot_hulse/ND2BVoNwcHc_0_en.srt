20
00:00:50,369 --> 00:00:54,899

pull people not so much make them dress

into something but see who they are kind

23
00:00:56,729 --> 00:00:59,968
<font color="#E5E5E5">of pull that out of them and it started</font>

24
00:00:58,890 --> 00:01:01,500
working really well with a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot of like</font>

25
00:00:59,969 --> 00:01:03,780
clients i had and people are just<font color="#E5E5E5"> giving</font>

26
00:01:01,500 --> 00:01:06,390
advice to you and even<font color="#E5E5E5"> with myself but</font>

27
00:01:03,780 --> 00:01:07,680
one thing I learned was basically how an

28
00:01:06,390 --> 00:01:09,719
outfit that you put together<font color="#E5E5E5"> and we're</font>

29
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:11,220
directly correlates with the type of

30
00:01:09,719 --> 00:01:13,829
girl that talks to<font color="#E5E5E5"> you or the type of</font>

31
00:01:11,219 --> 00:01:15,658
guy that talks<font color="#E5E5E5"> to you and all these</font>

32
00:01:13,829 --> 00:01:17,728
things when you're learning style and

33
00:01:15,659 --> 00:01:20,280
learning you know fashion like they were

34
00:01:17,728 --> 00:01:21,359
really interesting to me because you

35
00:01:20,280 --> 00:01:22,710
know if you're trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> make more</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> money</font>

36
00:01:21,359 --> 00:01:24,450
get a better career you want to attract

37
00:01:22,709 --> 00:01:25,798
the proper people<font color="#E5E5E5"> into your life right</font>

38
00:01:24,450 --> 00:01:27,540
if you're trying to<font color="#E5E5E5"> get laid or meet</font>

39
00:01:25,799 --> 00:01:29,189
women you want to attract a certain type

40
00:01:27,540 --> 00:01:30,840
of woman into your life and that may or

41
00:01:29,188 --> 00:01:31,949
<font color="#CCCCCC">may not be a woman I just</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> want to sleep</font>

42
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:34,710
with you maybe you want one that's

43
00:01:31,950 --> 00:01:36,090
career oriented goal-oriented right not

44
00:01:34,709 --> 00:01:37,408
whatever whatever you're wearing is

45
00:01:36,090 --> 00:01:39,420
going to attract the type of<font color="#CCCCCC"> team to you</font>

46
00:01:37,409 --> 00:01:41,219
yeah so what you're saying but not

47
00:01:39,420 --> 00:01:42,570
everybody is going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be comfortable</font>

48
00:01:41,219 --> 00:01:43,978
<font color="#E5E5E5">just saying oh well you need to wear a</font>

159
00:05:23,908 --> 00:05:27,658
<font color="#E5E5E5">you look at what they wear when they're</font>

that athlete vibe so I didn't want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

203
00:06:46,538 --> 00:06:50,738
when you so when a guy comes to consult

204
00:06:48,369 --> 00:06:53,949
<font color="#CCCCCC">with you the first thing you do is</font>

205
00:06:50,738 --> 00:06:56,138
assess him getting what his interests

206
00:06:53,949 --> 00:06:57,999
are what his values off what his

207
00:06:56,139 --> 00:07:00,519
aspirations are and instead<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> trying to</font>

208
00:06:57,999 --> 00:07:02,889
fit him into a style yeah you just try

209
00:07:00,519 --> 00:07:05,588
to blend it around here bring it<font color="#E5E5E5"> into</font>

210
00:07:02,889 --> 00:07:06,338
him I mean and the now obviously some

211
00:07:05,588 --> 00:07:08,740
things are going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to be a little</font>

212
00:07:06,338 --> 00:07:11,228
<font color="#E5E5E5">different if they're like dressing like</font>

213
00:07:08,740 --> 00:07:14,139
the guy that asked a question and is you

214
00:07:11,228 --> 00:07:15,459
know basketball shorts a t-shirt pretty

222
00:07:28,269 --> 00:07:30,749
the else could matter was like what do I

223

227
00:07:36,189 --> 00:07:38,829
people that like I wear what I want

228

00:07:57,338 --> 00:08:01,178
jacket but take it to the tailor for<font color="#CCCCCC"> 10</font>

243
00:08:09,399 --> 00:08:12,999
number one is there's some kind of two

244
00:08:11,319 --> 00:08:14,979
rules that<font color="#CCCCCC"> I tend to go by and that's</font>

245
00:08:12,999 --> 00:08:17,499
first it's got to fit you perfectly and

246
00:08:14,978 --> 00:08:18,459
a lot of<font color="#E5E5E5"> people have this stigma with</font>

247
00:08:17,499 --> 00:08:21,639
Taylor and they think<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's really</font>

248
00:08:18,459 --> 00:08:23,709
expensive well I maybe spend<font color="#E5E5E5"> 20 bucks at</font>

249
00:08:21,639 --> 00:08:25,449
most at the tailor and that's if like I

250
00:08:23,709 --> 00:08:27,459
<font color="#CCCCCC">have to like redo a pair of pants to fit</font>

251
00:08:25,449 --> 00:08:29,278
me hmm but most of like your guys that

252
00:08:27,459 --> 00:08:32,288
work<font color="#E5E5E5"> on Wall Street most year you know</font>

253
00:08:29,278 --> 00:08:33,458
<font color="#E5E5E5">really wealthy people that were really</font>

254
00:08:32,288 --> 00:08:35,198
well fitting suits and clothes all the

255
00:08:33,458 --> 00:08:37,149
time they're all<font color="#E5E5E5"> custom-made for them</font>

256
00:08:35,198 --> 00:08:38,139
well that's really<font color="#E5E5E5"> expensive so it's</font>

257
00:08:37,149 --> 00:08:40,269
<font color="#CCCCCC">like well you can take</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a shirt that</font>

258
00:08:38,139 --> 00:08:42,610
maybe cost you twenty bucks go to a

259
00:08:40,269 --> 00:08:43,929
local tailor and spend 10 to get it made

260
00:08:42,610 --> 00:08:45,519
for and then that shit look like it's

261
00:08:43,929 --> 00:08:48,008
made for you it looks like it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> made for</font>

262
00:08:45,519 --> 00:08:49,360
you it cost you thirty bucks yeah so

263
00:08:48,009 --> 00:08:50,889
mostly don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> even know that that option</font>

264
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:53,438
exists so that's like number one is like

265
00:08:50,889 --> 00:08:55,568
<font color="#E5E5E5">make sure all your clothes fit properly</font>

266
00:08:53,438 --> 00:08:58,240
some people follow our lucky and they

267
00:08:55,568 --> 00:09:01,028
fall into a body type where it actually

268
00:08:58,240 --> 00:09:03,100
fits companies very well so I they don't

269
00:09:01,028 --> 00:09:05,860
need that dude cuz clothes companies

270
00:09:03,100 --> 00:09:08,170
don't really make clothes for guys that

271
00:09:05,860 --> 00:09:10,329
lift<font color="#E5E5E5"> to know I mean what's the a lot of</font>

272
00:09:08,169 --> 00:09:11,889
times I'm having to get my I'm short as

273

tailored for my quad size for<font color="#CCCCCC"> the length</font>

275
00:09:14,769 --> 00:09:19,058
also upper body we tend<font color="#CCCCCC"> to be broad so</font>

276
00:09:17,350 --> 00:09:22,389
if you a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the guys are watched as</font>

277
00:09:19,058 --> 00:09:24,490
they lift so if the situation is that

278
00:09:22,389 --> 00:09:25,959
<font color="#E5E5E5">like yo you go to the nice you buy a</font>

387
00:13:11,769 --> 00:13:16,329
very hard right like<font color="#E5E5E5"> because most guys</font>

388
00:13:13,659 --> 00:13:18,819
are wearing t-shirts from high school

389

00:13:43,690 --> 00:13:47,770
always<font color="#E5E5E5"> have like their old brown loafers</font>

403
00:13:45,690 --> 00:13:49,690
sometimes they don't even match the belt

404
00:13:47,769 --> 00:13:51,399
so it looks real weird and they have a

405
00:13:49,690 --> 00:13:53,110
shirt that's like what it has called

406
