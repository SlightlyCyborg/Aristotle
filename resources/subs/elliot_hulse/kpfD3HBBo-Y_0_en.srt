11
00:00:24,600 --> 00:00:27,868
throughout the course of the bad

12
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:30,390
relationship her ex-boyfriend stayed

13
00:00:27,868 --> 00:00:32,609
with her to support her emotionally and

14
00:00:30,390 --> 00:00:35,270
now they're back together it's been

15
00:00:32,609 --> 00:00:37,979
three years<font color="#E5E5E5"> but she still carries a</font>

16
00:00:35,270 --> 00:00:39,420
great sense of guilt and a lot of pain

17
00:00:37,979 --> 00:00:42,929
associated with<font color="#E5E5E5"> the actions that she</font>

18
00:00:39,420 --> 00:00:44,899
made before so Maria what I like to

19
00:00:42,929 --> 00:00:48,299
offer you first is a perspective a

20
00:00:44,899 --> 00:00:51,090
<font color="#E5E5E5">reality that we've come to ignore due to</font>

21
00:00:48,299 --> 00:00:54,390
political correctness and the evening

22
00:00:51,090 --> 00:00:56,430
out of the sexes and and so on<font color="#E5E5E5"> and so</font>

23
00:00:54,390 --> 00:00:59,219
forth we've got<font color="#E5E5E5"> to understand that</font>

24
00:00:56,429 --> 00:01:02,899
although men and women are equal in

25
00:00:59,219 --> 00:01:06,359
every single regard we are<font color="#E5E5E5"> completely</font>

26
00:01:02,899 --> 00:01:08,549
different not<font color="#CCCCCC"> only different we are</font>

27
00:01:06,359 --> 00:01:11,599
diametrically opposed we are like a

28
00:01:08,549 --> 00:01:14,689
<font color="#E5E5E5">positive and negative Pole right</font>

29
00:01:11,599 --> 00:01:18,688
<font color="#E5E5E5">completely opposite where the man</font>

30
00:01:14,688 --> 00:01:20,429
physically<font color="#CCCCCC"> emotionally reaches out just</font>

31
00:01:18,688 --> 00:01:22,829
think of the penis the body has

32
00:01:20,430 --> 00:01:26,580
stimulated energy<font color="#CCCCCC"> Rises the penis</font>

33
00:01:22,829 --> 00:01:28,828

34
00:01:26,579 --> 00:01:31,259
forward expresses himself in the world

35
00:01:28,828 --> 00:01:35,129
the woman physically emotionally

36
00:01:31,259 --> 00:01:38,069
psychologically opens up where the man

37
00:01:35,129 --> 00:01:42,599
hardens and reaches out the woman

38
00:01:38,069 --> 00:01:45,000
softens and brings in and this is not

39
00:01:42,599 --> 00:01:46,228
just penis and vagina talk and a<font color="#CCCCCC"> lot of</font>

40

times people want to know<font color="#E5E5E5"> like</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Elliot</font>

some sort of pervert this is the the

42
00:01:48,629 --> 00:01:52,978
essence of the sexes this is the essence

43
00:01:51,209 --> 00:01:54,750
of what it<font color="#CCCCCC"> is to be a man and a woman to</font>

44
00:01:52,978 --> 00:01:58,890
understand that not only do it does our

body reach out or or or absorb or open

46
00:01:58,890 --> 00:02:05,819
up or soften like the woman does like

47
00:02:01,618 --> 00:02:09,709
her vagina does the emotions<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

aggressive hard reaching out tendency

55
00:02:27,729 --> 00:02:32,500
it's not the<font color="#CCCCCC"> natural tendency for women</font>

56
00:02:30,729 --> 00:02:34,169
all they'll be we've conditioned them

57
00:02:32,500 --> 00:02:37,930
because we live in a male-dominated

58
00:02:34,169 --> 00:02:40,659
ominous where there's a patriarchal

59
00:02:37,930 --> 00:02:43,300
hierarchy and everybody's shitting on

60
00:02:40,659 --> 00:02:45,129
everybody else the female woman the

61
00:02:43,300 --> 00:02:48,160
yielding quality of the softening

62
00:02:45,129 --> 00:02:51,969
quality is not respected it's not

63
00:02:48,159 --> 00:02:55,960
honored it's it's really in some

64
00:02:51,969 --> 00:02:58,479
cultures squashed covered and in our

65
00:02:55,960 --> 00:03:02,740
culture in the West transformed so women

66
00:02:58,479 --> 00:03:04,750
are unfortunately for all of us<font color="#E5E5E5"> women</font>

67
00:03:02,740 --> 00:03:06,400
are becoming<font color="#E5E5E5"> more like men that doesn't</font>

68
00:03:04,750 --> 00:03:10,930
mean<font color="#CCCCCC"> that they're growing penises but</font>

69
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:13,960
there's more<font color="#E5E5E5"> male there's more male</font>

70
00:03:10,930 --> 00:03:15,849
attributes to their character because

71
00:03:13,960 --> 00:03:18,879
you've<font color="#E5E5E5"> got to compete in an increasingly</font>

72
00:03:15,849 --> 00:03:20,620
penis dominated world so you're probably

73
00:03:18,879 --> 00:03:22,989
wondering<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know what the hell am I</font>

74
00:03:20,620 --> 00:03:25,810
<font color="#E5E5E5">talking about why is this relevant well</font>

75
00:03:22,989 --> 00:03:27,789
the reason why he can get<font color="#CCCCCC"> over things is</font>

76
00:03:25,810 --> 00:03:30,039
because he reaches out he's moving

77
00:03:27,789 --> 00:03:32,319
forward he's moving on you on the other

78
00:03:30,039 --> 00:03:34,659
hand<font color="#E5E5E5"> are holding a deep sense of regret</font>

79
00:03:32,319 --> 00:03:36,639
and I think the guilt and the pain<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

80
00:03:34,659 --> 00:03:38,829
you're feeling is not so<font color="#E5E5E5"> much that you</font>

81
00:03:36,639 --> 00:03:41,189
hurt him because<font color="#E5E5E5"> the man will move on</font>

82
00:03:38,830 --> 00:03:45,070
especially if he has<font color="#CCCCCC"> a lot of masculine</font>

83
00:03:41,189 --> 00:03:47,979
characteristics he'll move on because he

84
00:03:45,069 --> 00:03:49,689
<font color="#E5E5E5">found a place to rest in you that's what</font>

85
00:03:47,979 --> 00:03:51,579
the man<font color="#E5E5E5"> does we go out and we look for a</font>

86
00:03:49,689 --> 00:03:54,459
place to<font color="#E5E5E5"> rest there's like the penis</font>

87
00:03:51,580 --> 00:03:56,890
<font color="#CCCCCC">look for</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a place</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> rest and apparently</font>

88
00:03:54,459 --> 00:04:01,409
founded in you you betrayed<font color="#CCCCCC"> him but I</font>

89
00:03:56,889 --> 00:04:04,689
<font color="#E5E5E5">think your pain is more associated with</font>

90
00:04:01,409 --> 00:04:08,560
the fact that you've opened up too

91
00:04:04,689 --> 00:04:10,919
easily was distracted and opened up too

92
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:14,349
easily to several different mistakes

93
00:04:10,919 --> 00:04:16,569
because the vagina is an opening of the

94
00:04:14,349 --> 00:04:18,909
body it's also an opening of the soul

95
00:04:16,569 --> 00:04:21,370
it's an opening of the individual and<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

96
00:04:18,910 --> 00:04:23,980
just let in especially to let in lots of

97
00:04:21,370 --> 00:04:27,129
mistakes is damaging

98
00:04:23,980 --> 00:04:29,620
to the spirit of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the individual now when</font>

99
00:04:27,129 --> 00:04:31,990
I say spirit i'm not talking<font color="#E5E5E5"> religiously</font>

100
00:04:29,620 --> 00:04:34,030
<font color="#CCCCCC">i'm talking about what's happening in at</font>

101
00:04:31,990 --> 00:04:36,069
a deep psychological emotional level for

102
00:04:34,029 --> 00:04:37,629
the individual that's why it's easy for

103
00:04:36,069 --> 00:04:40,000
men to go out and<font color="#E5E5E5"> cheat all the time we</font>

104
00:04:37,629 --> 00:04:44,500
because nothing gets inside us doesn't

105
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:47,699
affect our heart our energy<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's out</font>

106
00:04:44,500 --> 00:04:50,290
right skeet skeet skeet right we're just

107
00:04:47,699 --> 00:04:54,009
<font color="#E5E5E5">we think nothing of it but for a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> woman</font>

108
00:04:50,290 --> 00:04:56,379
you've<font color="#E5E5E5"> got to protect yourself I know I</font>

109
00:04:54,009 --> 00:04:59,560
might sound sexist here but the reality

110
00:04:56,379 --> 00:05:02,409
is just look at the metaphor the<font color="#E5E5E5"> vagina</font>

111
00:04:59,560 --> 00:05:03,939
opens you up you've got to not only open

112
00:05:02,410 --> 00:05:06,189
up but you've got to soften and what

113
00:05:03,939 --> 00:05:10,480
happens when you soften your body allow

114
00:05:06,189 --> 00:05:11,889
it to open to men is you bring in not

115
00:05:10,480 --> 00:05:13,660
only<font color="#CCCCCC"> their body but you bring in their</font>

116
00:05:11,889 --> 00:05:16,360
energy and then the entire<font color="#E5E5E5"> relationship</font>

117
00:05:13,660 --> 00:05:17,980
<font color="#CCCCCC">is associated with you yielding and them</font>

118
00:05:16,360 --> 00:05:21,040
approaching and if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> find that you</font>

119
00:05:17,980 --> 00:05:22,480
made mistakes about<font color="#E5E5E5"> opening up to the</font>

120
00:05:21,040 --> 00:05:25,140
wrong people which you have in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> past</font>

121
00:05:22,480 --> 00:05:28,689
there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to be a sense of guilt</font>

122
00:05:25,139 --> 00:05:30,879
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> you have for opening up too easily</font>

123
00:05:28,689 --> 00:05:33,699
you're going to carry that the other

124
00:05:30,879 --> 00:05:36,310
thing<font color="#CCCCCC"> is that when you realize that</font>

125
00:05:33,699 --> 00:05:37,959
you've opened up too easily there's

126
00:05:36,310 --> 00:05:41,079
<font color="#E5E5E5">going to be a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> tendency to want to close</font>

127
00:05:37,959 --> 00:05:44,379
down again because you realize you know

128
00:05:41,079 --> 00:05:46,120
I opened myself up to this man I hurt

129
00:05:44,379 --> 00:05:48,040
him then I<font color="#CCCCCC"> opened myself up to another</font>

130
00:05:46,120 --> 00:05:50,430
man that<font color="#E5E5E5"> hurt me and then this whole</font>

131
00:05:48,040 --> 00:05:53,439
opening up thing becomes confusing

132
00:05:50,430 --> 00:05:56,170
distracting hurtful painful and then the

133
00:05:53,439 --> 00:05:57,790
tendencies to close down so you may

134
00:05:56,170 --> 00:05:59,140
experience now this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> just</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> all the</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">guests based on the information you've</font>

136
00:05:59,139 --> 00:06:03,610
given me you may experience now an

137
00:06:01,149 --> 00:06:05,979
inability to open up<font color="#CCCCCC"> to the one that</font>

138
00:06:03,610 --> 00:06:09,759
truly does love you to the one that is

139
00:06:05,980 --> 00:06:12,009
worth allowing to rest in you that maybe

140
00:06:09,759 --> 00:06:16,329
another part<font color="#E5E5E5"> of your guilt my point here</font>

141
00:06:12,009 --> 00:06:17,889
<font color="#E5E5E5">is that the guilt is yours the when I</font>

142
00:06:16,329 --> 00:06:19,389
use the<font color="#CCCCCC"> term guilt I'm talking about the</font>

143
00:06:17,889 --> 00:06:20,740
cognitive dissonance between what you've

144
00:06:19,389 --> 00:06:23,199
done and what you're thinking the moral

145
00:06:20,740 --> 00:06:27,129
judgment is one hundred percent yours he

146
00:06:23,199 --> 00:06:29,289
