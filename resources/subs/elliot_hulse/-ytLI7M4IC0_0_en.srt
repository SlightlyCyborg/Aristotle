1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,299
so this morning I posted a picture<font color="#E5E5E5"> of a</font>

2
00:00:01,740 --> 00:00:05,910
book that I'm now reading or listening

3
00:00:03,299 --> 00:00:07,349
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> on my</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Facebook Wall it's a book by</font>

4
00:00:05,910 --> 00:00:09,330
paulo coelho and if you've watched

5
00:00:07,349 --> 00:00:11,428
enough my videos you know that<font color="#CCCCCC"> i highly</font>

6
00:00:09,330 --> 00:00:13,469
<font color="#E5E5E5">recommend his books they're fictional</font>

7
00:00:11,429 --> 00:00:15,388
and they're probably the only fiction

8
00:00:13,468 --> 00:00:17,579
books that i read they're fantastic and

9
00:00:15,388 --> 00:00:19,500
they've been supportive to me on

10
00:00:17,579 --> 00:00:21,659
becoming<font color="#CCCCCC"> the strongest version of myself</font>

11
00:00:19,500 --> 00:00:24,359
and a big part of my mission is to

12
00:00:21,660 --> 00:00:26,250
simply share the resources<font color="#E5E5E5"> that have</font>

13
00:00:24,359 --> 00:00:28,260
supported<font color="#E5E5E5"> me and growing stronger in</font>

14
00:00:26,250 --> 00:00:30,839
hopes that perhaps they could support

15
00:00:28,260 --> 00:00:33,179
you and I<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't ever I don't expect</font>

16
00:00:30,839 --> 00:00:37,799
everyone to have the same experience or

17
00:00:33,179 --> 00:00:40,409
two or to receive<font color="#E5E5E5"> all of these gifts</font>

18
00:00:37,799 --> 00:00:41,699
they're not for everyone but anyway one

19
00:00:40,409 --> 00:00:43,139
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the comments that I received on the</font>

20
00:00:41,700 --> 00:00:46,649
picture was from a gentleman through

21
00:00:43,140 --> 00:00:50,219
what I believe<font color="#E5E5E5"> was his truest sentiment</font>

22
00:00:46,649 --> 00:00:52,679
from his heart says be<font color="#CCCCCC"> careful when</font>

23
00:00:50,219 --> 00:00:54,359
reading this author and of<font color="#CCCCCC"> course the</font>

24
00:00:52,679 --> 00:00:57,149
very first reaction in my body is

25
00:00:54,359 --> 00:01:00,509
defense and it's just you know who I am

26
00:00:57,149 --> 00:01:02,100
it's what I'm working with but instantly

27
00:01:00,509 --> 00:01:03,719
I began to think<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> myself why would</font>

28
00:01:02,100 --> 00:01:06,359
<font color="#E5E5E5">somebody say something like this what</font>

29
00:01:03,719 --> 00:01:08,909
exactly is his particular superstition

30
00:01:06,359 --> 00:01:10,379
so of course<font color="#CCCCCC"> I begin with prejudice and</font>

31
00:01:08,909 --> 00:01:12,150
I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think boy you know what kind of</font>

32
00:01:10,379 --> 00:01:14,310
superstition is this guy holding<font color="#CCCCCC"> on to</font>

33
00:01:12,150 --> 00:01:19,020
that doesn't allow him to expose himself

34
00:01:14,310 --> 00:01:25,409
to any ideas you see the<font color="#E5E5E5"> greatest form</font>

35
00:01:19,019 --> 00:01:28,170
of of slavery is the barring off of

36
00:01:25,409 --> 00:01:30,630
particular ideas that might perhaps

37
00:01:28,170 --> 00:01:33,240
embolden you to take action<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the</font>

38
00:01:30,629 --> 00:01:35,670
direction in a direction that perhaps

39
00:01:33,239 --> 00:01:37,170
others would tell you no don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> do it you</font>

40
00:01:35,670 --> 00:01:39,450
know they set up their own rules and

41
00:01:37,170 --> 00:01:41,159
their own boundaries and for whatever

42
00:01:39,450 --> 00:01:42,780
reason they feel as if they need to

43
00:01:41,159 --> 00:01:46,469
<font color="#E5E5E5">subject you to those rules and</font>

44
00:01:42,780 --> 00:01:50,040
boundaries and in order<font color="#CCCCCC"> to keep those</font>

45
00:01:46,469 --> 00:01:52,019
rules and boundaries stable you've got

46
00:01:50,040 --> 00:01:54,840
to keep people ignorant you've got to

47
00:01:52,019 --> 00:01:56,489
keep them blinded from particular ideas

48
00:01:54,840 --> 00:02:02,040
and that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> why in my model of personal</font>

49
00:01:56,489 --> 00:02:05,310
development you do not reject any ideas

50
00:02:02,040 --> 00:02:07,170
before exploring them fully nothing is

51
00:02:05,310 --> 00:02:09,989
off limits when it comes to trying to

52
00:02:07,170 --> 00:02:14,430
<font color="#CCCCCC">find gems of wisdom that might be</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> hidden</font>

53
00:02:09,989 --> 00:02:16,599
under<font color="#E5E5E5"> all types of strange rocks</font>

54
00:02:14,430 --> 00:02:18,700
nothing is<font color="#E5E5E5"> off-limits if it has a</font>

55
00:02:16,598 --> 00:02:20,259
potential to<font color="#CCCCCC"> help you grow and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> become</font>

56
00:02:18,699 --> 00:02:22,959
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> strongest version himself regardless</font>

57
00:02:20,259 --> 00:02:28,149
<font color="#CCCCCC">of where it comes from or what it's</font>

58
00:02:22,959 --> 00:02:34,959
called you have to experience this so

59
00:02:28,150 --> 00:02:38,590
then<font color="#E5E5E5"> I began thinking about what should</font>

60
00:02:34,959 --> 00:02:40,569
<font color="#CCCCCC">be</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> off limits what things should we not</font>

61
00:02:38,590 --> 00:02:44,680
subject ourselves to what ideas should

62
00:02:40,568 --> 00:02:47,078
we not expose ourselves to and I often

63
00:02:44,680 --> 00:02:48,969
say things like don't listen to to music

64
00:02:47,079 --> 00:02:50,260
that is aggressive or not even

65
00:02:48,969 --> 00:02:51,848
<font color="#E5E5E5">aggressive aggressive is a beautiful</font>

66
00:02:50,259 --> 00:02:54,548
thing but violent violence is an ugly

67
00:02:51,848 --> 00:02:56,979
thing violent or watch movies that are

68
00:02:54,549 --> 00:02:58,450
violent and then I<font color="#E5E5E5"> began to think you</font>

69
00:02:56,979 --> 00:03:00,729
know when I say these things they're

70
00:02:58,449 --> 00:03:03,939
merely my experience and a better way

71
00:03:00,729 --> 00:03:06,548
for me to<font color="#E5E5E5"> simply place this is when</font>

72
00:03:03,939 --> 00:03:08,109
you're growing stronger when you're

73
00:03:06,549 --> 00:03:11,709
becoming a stronger version of yourself

74
00:03:08,109 --> 00:03:13,989
you'll<font color="#E5E5E5"> find that your body rejects</font>

75
00:03:11,709 --> 00:03:16,299
certain things without<font color="#CCCCCC"> you having to</font>

76
00:03:13,989 --> 00:03:19,180
think about it there's a sense of

77
00:03:16,299 --> 00:03:21,700
intuition and awareness that you now

78
00:03:19,180 --> 00:03:24,549
carry with yourself in your physiology

79
00:03:21,699 --> 00:03:27,759
in your heart in your gut that doesn't

80
00:03:24,549 --> 00:03:30,669
require you to reject anything or to be

81
00:03:27,759 --> 00:03:35,138
cautious at all because in the same way

82
00:03:30,669 --> 00:03:37,840
that if you ingest rotten milks boiled

83
00:03:35,139 --> 00:03:40,090
nasty milk you don't have to be very

84
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:41,979
cautious because your body will

85
00:03:40,090 --> 00:03:44,079
instantly reject it that is the

86
00:03:41,979 --> 00:03:46,689
brilliance of your body it knows that an

87
00:03:44,079 --> 00:03:50,109
intuitive level what is poisonous to it

88
00:03:46,689 --> 00:03:55,598
the same it is<font color="#E5E5E5"> the same is it it goes</font>

89
00:03:50,109 --> 00:03:59,519
with ideas exposure to ideas there are

90
00:03:55,598 --> 00:04:02,289
some ideas<font color="#E5E5E5"> that when you're exposed to</font>

91
00:03:59,519 --> 00:04:04,780
your body simply rejects without you

92
00:04:02,289 --> 00:04:07,568
having to do anything about it so when I

93
00:04:04,780 --> 00:04:09,400
hear music or I watched or their movies

94
00:04:07,568 --> 00:04:10,568
that are being played in my vicinity you

95
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:16,439
know there's music that's played in my

96
00:04:10,568 --> 00:04:19,298
vicinity that simply doesn't resonate

97
00:04:16,439 --> 00:04:21,759
with my physiology I don't have to be

98
00:04:19,298 --> 00:04:23,679
vigilant my body simply rejects it I

99
00:04:21,759 --> 00:04:25,990
don't listen to<font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I don't hear it it</font>

100
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:27,340
could be playing blasting in my ears but

101
00:04:25,990 --> 00:04:29,230
I<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't hear it so</font>

102
00:04:27,339 --> 00:04:32,379
when<font color="#E5E5E5"> I say these things like exposing</font>

103
00:04:29,230 --> 00:04:33,580
yourself to violent music might not

104
00:04:32,379 --> 00:04:36,189
allow<font color="#E5E5E5"> you to become a stronger version</font>

105
00:04:33,579 --> 00:04:38,079
yourself I'm wrong when<font color="#E5E5E5"> I say that what</font>

106
00:04:36,189 --> 00:04:40,269
I really mean to say is in the same way

107
00:04:38,079 --> 00:04:42,490
that Jesus describes the kingdom it

108
00:04:40,269 --> 00:04:46,240
isn't so much a<font color="#E5E5E5"> Dow Alton thou shalt not</font>

109
00:04:42,490 --> 00:04:48,430
but this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is what you'll experience when</font>

110
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:50,199
you find the kingdom this is what you'll

111
00:04:48,430 --> 00:04:52,478
experience when you become a stronger

112
00:04:50,199 --> 00:04:54,100
version of yourself you'll experience

113
00:04:52,478 --> 00:04:55,899
that your body will instantly reject

114
00:04:54,100 --> 00:04:58,860
certain things without you<font color="#E5E5E5"> having to do</font>

115
00:04:55,899 --> 00:05:00,909
so and there is no need for vigilance

116
00:04:58,860 --> 00:05:02,949
there are certain ideas that you'll be

117
00:05:00,910 --> 00:05:04,660
exposed to<font color="#E5E5E5"> that you're simply not ready</font>

118
00:05:02,949 --> 00:05:07,418
for and there's no need to reject it you

119
00:05:04,660 --> 00:05:09,040
just<font color="#E5E5E5"> set it aside okay especially if</font>

120
00:05:07,418 --> 00:05:12,639
those ideas seem to be working for<font color="#E5E5E5"> other</font>

121
00:05:09,040 --> 00:05:14,050
people and you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know if ideas are working</font>

122
00:05:12,639 --> 00:05:17,259
<font color="#E5E5E5">for other people by the look in their</font>

123
00:05:14,050 --> 00:05:19,270
eyes not the station that they<font color="#E5E5E5"> carry in</font>

124
00:05:17,259 --> 00:05:21,099
life or what they call themselves but by

125
00:05:19,269 --> 00:05:24,579
the look in their eyes<font color="#CCCCCC"> and the smile on</font>

126
00:05:21,100 --> 00:05:26,350
their face clearly that idea is working

127
00:05:24,579 --> 00:05:28,839
for<font color="#CCCCCC"> you but it'll not ready for it right</font>

128
00:05:26,350 --> 00:05:37,660
now that doesn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> require</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> rejection it</font>

129
00:05:28,839 --> 00:05:40,029
requires sensitivity and openness so how

130
00:05:37,660 --> 00:05:43,419
do you come to this place where you

131
00:05:40,029 --> 00:05:46,809
begin trusting your heart and your body

132
00:05:43,418 --> 00:05:48,370
your physiology your gut as opposed to

133
00:05:46,810 --> 00:05:50,139
always having to stand vigilant and

134
00:05:48,370 --> 00:05:51,728
never allowing yourself to be exposed<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

135
00:05:50,139 --> 00:05:53,560
certain things<font color="#E5E5E5"> that might nourish you</font>

136
00:05:51,728 --> 00:05:56,019
even though you've been<font color="#E5E5E5"> told that</font>

137
00:05:53,560 --> 00:06:00,129
they're evil or wrong or to be cautious

138
00:05:56,019 --> 00:06:02,109
against it the answer is simple<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's the</font>

139
00:06:00,129 --> 00:06:04,899
one that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I often offer that is to</font>

140
00:06:02,110 --> 00:06:06,610
breathe into your balls and<font color="#CCCCCC"> when I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> say</font>

143
00:06:10,329 --> 00:06:17,889

awareness of<font color="#E5E5E5"> your body and recognize</font>

145
00:06:17,889 --> 00:06:25,710
whether or not your body is unready for

146
00:06:21,129 --> 00:06:28,930
a particular idea simply rejecting an

147
00:06:25,709 --> 00:06:31,569
idea which means you don't need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do</font>

148
00:06:28,930 --> 00:06:33,550
anything your<font color="#E5E5E5"> body just rejects it you</font>

149
00:06:31,569 --> 00:06:34,899
could be told a certain thing thousand

150
00:06:33,550 --> 00:06:36,699
times you could be<font color="#E5E5E5"> exposed to a certain</font>

151
00:06:34,899 --> 00:06:39,038
thing a thousand times but it won't get

152
00:06:36,699 --> 00:06:40,329
<font color="#E5E5E5">through because you're not ready for</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font>

153
00:06:39,038 --> 00:06:42,959
we say get through but really

154
00:06:40,329 --> 00:06:45,008
it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not getting through your body and</font>

155
00:06:42,959 --> 00:06:47,709
then there<font color="#CCCCCC"> are those ideas that</font>

156
00:06:45,009 --> 00:06:50,379
revolutionize you through courage and

157
00:06:47,709 --> 00:06:52,478
passion and the minute you're exposed to

158
00:06:50,379 --> 00:06:55,750
it you know that it's for you not

159
00:06:52,478 --> 00:06:57,459
because of who told you it's for you not

160
00:06:55,750 --> 00:07:00,310
because of anything except<font color="#CCCCCC"> for the fact</font>

161
00:06:57,459 --> 00:07:03,008
that you're emboldened your heart rate

162
00:07:00,310 --> 00:07:05,199
goes up your body feels a sense of

163
00:07:03,009 --> 00:07:07,180
excitement and<font color="#CCCCCC"> all you want to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> do is</font>

164
00:07:05,199 --> 00:07:09,728
dive deeper and deeper and deeper into

165
00:07:07,180 --> 00:07:12,550
<font color="#E5E5E5">the idea until it takes</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> over your life</font>

166
00:07:09,728 --> 00:07:17,228
and transforms you from the inside out

167
00:07:12,550 --> 00:07:20,020
and then all you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> do is share that</font>

168
00:07:17,228 --> 00:07:22,029
experience with other people because you

169
00:07:20,019 --> 00:07:25,269
know that it supported you on becoming a

170
00:07:22,029 --> 00:07:28,839
strongest version of yourself that is an

171
00:07:25,269 --> 00:07:31,060
act of love but when<font color="#E5E5E5"> you hold so tight</font>

172
00:07:28,839 --> 00:07:33,008
to that experience and the place where

173
00:07:31,060 --> 00:07:36,158
you receive that<font color="#E5E5E5"> experience that you</font>

begin forcing it<font color="#CCCCCC"> on</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> other people you</font>

175
00:07:36,158 --> 00:07:39,699
start telling them how this is the way

00:07:37,778 --> 00:07:41,589
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is the only way look at what</font>
