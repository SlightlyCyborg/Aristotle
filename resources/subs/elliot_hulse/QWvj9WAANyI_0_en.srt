1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,099
so we've got a question here about how

2
00:00:02,129 --> 00:00:07,439
to be good at being bad and basically

3
00:00:05,099 --> 00:00:09,750
the question is how do I accept<font color="#E5E5E5"> it when</font>

4
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:11,699
someone beats me or someone's better

5
00:00:09,750 --> 00:00:14,250
than me at something I'm a very

6
00:00:11,699 --> 00:00:16,500
competitive person but I<font color="#E5E5E5"> can't get</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> over</font>

7
00:00:14,250 --> 00:00:19,410
this deep-seated feeling of resentment

8
00:00:16,500 --> 00:00:21,600
and anger towards someone who's better

9
00:00:19,410 --> 00:00:24,390
than me right we live in<font color="#CCCCCC"> a world where</font>

10
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:26,099
everyone's a winner and you should pack

11
00:00:24,390 --> 00:00:28,410
the winner<font color="#CCCCCC"> on the back if you happen to</font>

12
00:00:26,099 --> 00:00:30,059
be a<font color="#E5E5E5"> loser feel good for him right feel</font>

13
00:00:28,410 --> 00:00:32,939
good for the guy that's done better than

14
00:00:30,059 --> 00:00:35,429
<font color="#E5E5E5">you the guy who's achieving greater</font>

15
00:00:32,939 --> 00:00:37,558
goals than you beating you winning and

16
00:00:35,429 --> 00:00:39,719
you're<font color="#CCCCCC"> not right we should all feel good</font>

17
00:00:37,558 --> 00:00:41,939
for each other we should all accept

18
00:00:39,719 --> 00:00:43,530
everybody as a winner right if you're

19
00:00:41,939 --> 00:00:46,019
anything like me which apparently are

20
00:00:43,530 --> 00:00:49,439
you are you've got this you know the

21
00:00:46,020 --> 00:00:51,960
perpetual phallic narcissist ideal that

22
00:00:49,439 --> 00:00:54,019
I should always win I'm always striving

23
00:00:51,960 --> 00:00:56,460
and I don't want anybody<font color="#E5E5E5"> to beat me as</font>

24
00:00:54,020 --> 00:00:58,859
much as I stand up here and I offer you

25
00:00:56,460 --> 00:01:00,149
guys all these philosophical ideas on

26
00:00:58,859 --> 00:01:04,228
becoming the strongest version yourself

27
00:01:00,149 --> 00:01:06,810
I cannot<font color="#E5E5E5"> lie and say that I don't become</font>

28
00:01:04,228 --> 00:01:08,969
hateful towards people who are crushing

29
00:01:06,810 --> 00:01:10,500
it where I'm not right this is I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think</font>

30
00:01:08,969 --> 00:01:12,569
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> normal and natural for most</font>

31
00:01:10,500 --> 00:01:16,109
people but we've suppressed that you

32
00:01:12,569 --> 00:01:18,539
know and the way I deal with it<font color="#E5E5E5"> is to do</font>

33
00:01:16,109 --> 00:01:21,810
as I typically recommend and that is to

34
00:01:18,540 --> 00:01:24,799
turn the attention back<font color="#E5E5E5"> to yourself so</font>

35
00:01:21,810 --> 00:01:27,659
if you're projecting outwards and you're

36
00:01:24,799 --> 00:01:29,820
you're literally spilling your energy in

37
00:01:27,659 --> 00:01:32,670
<font color="#E5E5E5">you're throwing it out</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and being upset</font>

38
00:01:29,819 --> 00:01:34,109
<font color="#CCCCCC">angry or jealous because really that's a</font>

39
00:01:32,670 --> 00:01:36,359
big part of it we've got<font color="#E5E5E5"> to admit you</font>

40
00:01:34,109 --> 00:01:38,609
<font color="#E5E5E5">know it is this is a form of jealousy</font>

41
00:01:36,359 --> 00:01:41,159
towards someone who's beaten you damn

42
00:01:38,609 --> 00:01:43,590
that guy got me he beat me<font color="#E5E5E5"> or he's</font>

43
00:01:41,159 --> 00:01:47,368
winning and you're not then you know in

44
00:01:43,590 --> 00:01:49,500
business in relationships and sports in

45
00:01:47,368 --> 00:01:52,409
life whatever it<font color="#E5E5E5"> is and you feel</font>

46
00:01:49,500 --> 00:01:53,759
animosity towards that person the very

47
00:01:52,409 --> 00:01:55,740
first thing you've got to do is

48
00:01:53,759 --> 00:01:57,060
recognize that the part of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> reason</font>

49
00:01:55,739 --> 00:01:58,500
why<font color="#E5E5E5"> you feel that way towards that</font>

50
00:01:57,060 --> 00:02:01,769
person is because you know you can do

51
00:01:58,500 --> 00:02:04,259
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> to you see so I get very upset not</font>

52
00:02:01,769 --> 00:02:05,640
so much with that<font color="#E5E5E5"> person I think I am</font>

53
00:02:04,259 --> 00:02:07,649
and you think you are it's not<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

54
00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:10,439
you're hateful towards them you just are

55
00:02:07,649 --> 00:02:11,659
eating up on the inside because<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

56
00:02:10,439 --> 00:02:14,150
realize

57
00:02:11,659 --> 00:02:16,939
I can beat<font color="#CCCCCC"> him I can do that that is</font>

58
00:02:14,150 --> 00:02:18,830
something in me that's being reflected

59
00:02:16,939 --> 00:02:21,530
in another human being and it's

60
00:02:18,830 --> 00:02:25,430
uncomfortable<font color="#CCCCCC"> I totally get it the</font>

61
00:02:21,530 --> 00:02:29,110
reality is the real feeling is coming

62
00:02:25,430 --> 00:02:31,400
from a sense that there is more

63
00:02:29,110 --> 00:02:33,410
available<font color="#CCCCCC"> to you yet you haven't</font>

64
00:02:31,400 --> 00:02:35,450
produced it yet so you've got<font color="#E5E5E5"> to get</font>

65
00:02:33,409 --> 00:02:38,210
busy quickly turn your attention back<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

66
00:02:35,449 --> 00:02:40,669
<font color="#E5E5E5">yourself get busy doing the things you</font>

67
00:02:38,210 --> 00:02:42,469
need to do<font color="#E5E5E5"> to get where he's going right</font>

68
00:02:40,669 --> 00:02:44,599
so take your attention<font color="#CCCCCC"> off of him don't</font>

69
00:02:42,469 --> 00:02:46,729
worry so much about him winning see it I

70
00:02:44,599 --> 00:02:48,889
that guy got me and then you turn your

71
00:02:46,729 --> 00:02:52,669
energy back to or two what can I do next

72
00:02:48,889 --> 00:02:56,089
that should always be your your<font color="#CCCCCC"> next</font>

73
00:02:52,669 --> 00:02:58,699
step what can I do next what am I going

74
00:02:56,090 --> 00:03:02,599
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> do about this not how can</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I take</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> him</font>

75
00:02:58,699 --> 00:03:05,569
down why he's a<font color="#CCCCCC"> douche bag and I'm not</font>

76
00:03:02,599 --> 00:03:08,419
why he doesn't deserve<font color="#CCCCCC"> that and I do all</font>

77
00:03:05,569 --> 00:03:10,609
of that serves no one and it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> stupid</font>

78
00:03:08,419 --> 00:03:13,489
quite frankly would you go to do is turn

79
00:03:10,610 --> 00:03:18,230
the attention back to<font color="#E5E5E5"> yourself and say</font>

80
00:03:13,490 --> 00:03:20,990
okay boom he's got me I can see a place

81
00:03:18,229 --> 00:03:25,099
where he's a bit<font color="#E5E5E5"> better than me how can</font>

82
00:03:20,990 --> 00:03:26,659
I build that in me so if for example you

83
00:03:25,099 --> 00:03:28,549
see that that guy you know let's say

84
00:03:26,659 --> 00:03:30,770
it's sports and you see boy he's a

85
00:03:28,550 --> 00:03:33,620
little bit faster<font color="#CCCCCC"> than me alright cool</font>

86
00:03:30,770 --> 00:03:35,750
got<font color="#CCCCCC"> it got it gotcha you go back and you</font>

87
00:03:33,620 --> 00:03:37,520
start focusing one hundred percent of

88
00:03:35,750 --> 00:03:41,569
<font color="#E5E5E5">your effort on building up that weaker</font>

89
00:03:37,520 --> 00:03:43,969
skill in you now you're doing what i

90
00:03:41,569 --> 00:03:46,519
call becoming a stronger version of

91
00:03:43,969 --> 00:03:49,370
yourself you<font color="#E5E5E5"> become a stronger version</font>

92
00:03:46,520 --> 00:03:52,489
of yourself and that is going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to afford</font>

93
00:03:49,370 --> 00:03:55,129
you the capacity<font color="#CCCCCC"> to supersede anybody</font>

94
00:03:52,489 --> 00:03:56,239
else who's outwardly focused so that's

95
00:03:55,129 --> 00:03:59,030
it man<font color="#CCCCCC"> i don't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> want to make this too</font>

96
00:03:56,239 --> 00:04:00,830
long i tend to rant don't worry so much

97
00:03:59,030 --> 00:04:02,780
about the<font color="#CCCCCC"> perseid you're going to feel</font>

98
00:04:00,830 --> 00:04:04,489
it don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> suppress it that's one of our</font>

99
00:04:02,780 --> 00:04:05,599
biggest problems we tend to suppress our

100
00:04:04,489 --> 00:04:08,659
feelings your feelings are right

101
00:04:05,599 --> 00:04:09,979
feelings are<font color="#E5E5E5"> always right what is</font>

102
00:04:08,659 --> 00:04:12,259
<font color="#E5E5E5">happening in your body is a function of</font>

103
00:04:09,979 --> 00:04:13,789
the autonomic nervous system it is<font color="#E5E5E5"> free</font>

104
00:04:12,259 --> 00:04:19,579
from your conscious thought you are

appreciate realize what it is but then

107
00:04:22,519 --> 00:04:29,759
<font color="#E5E5E5">don't tie negative associations to it</font>

108
00:04:25,350 --> 00:04:32,490
and honestly<font color="#E5E5E5"> recognize it for what it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

109
00:04:29,759 --> 00:04:35,490
it is a perception<font color="#E5E5E5"> that you are not</font>

110
00:04:32,490 --> 00:04:37,199
living up to the magnificence that's in

111
00:04:35,490 --> 00:04:39,210
you and then<font color="#E5E5E5"> turn your energy towards</font>

112
00:04:37,199 --> 00:04:43,289
yourself and focus on becoming stronger

113
00:04:39,209 --> 00:04:49,339
version of yourself that was a long

114
00:04:43,290 --> 00:04:49,340
video<font color="#CCCCCC"> to make</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a simple point good luck</font>
