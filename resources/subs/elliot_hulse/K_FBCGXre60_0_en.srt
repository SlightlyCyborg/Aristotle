get started today with our topic on

12
00:00:25,140 --> 00:00:30,810
spontaneous manifestation how to get

13
00:00:28,260 --> 00:00:33,420

15
00:00:33,420 --> 00:00:37,739
discovered and<font color="#E5E5E5"> experienced this weekend</font>

16
00:00:35,488 --> 00:00:39,599
so<font color="#E5E5E5"> the very first thing i want to share</font>

17
00:00:37,738 --> 00:00:42,599
is our<font color="#CCCCCC"> experience with the grow stronger</font>

00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:46,620
experience and that is that i spoke on

19
00:00:42,600 --> 00:00:48,629
Friday on multiple different topics of

20
00:00:46,619 --> 00:00:49,738
great interest to me<font color="#E5E5E5"> and obviously great</font>

21
00:00:48,628 --> 00:00:52,140
interest to the people<font color="#CCCCCC"> that were</font>

22
00:00:49,738 --> 00:00:54,089
attending especially since getting the

23
00:00:52,140 --> 00:00:55,920
feedback so the first thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> is that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

24
00:00:54,090 --> 00:01:00,030
opened up<font color="#E5E5E5"> and I spoke about death and</font>

25
00:00:55,920 --> 00:01:01,980
<font color="#E5E5E5">rebirth as a theme in life I also spoke</font>

26
00:01:00,030 --> 00:01:04,739
about<font color="#E5E5E5"> the four layers of strength that</font>

27
00:01:01,979 --> 00:01:07,769
one is a<font color="#E5E5E5"> great detail and practical</font>

28
00:01:04,739 --> 00:01:10,409
application both in my own personal<font color="#CCCCCC"> life</font>

29
00:01:07,769 --> 00:01:12,478
and journey as well as tips and ideas

30
00:01:10,409 --> 00:01:13,978
for people<font color="#CCCCCC"> going through their journey</font>

31
00:01:12,478 --> 00:01:15,659
on how to use<font color="#E5E5E5"> the four layers of</font>

32
00:01:13,978 --> 00:01:17,700
strength<font color="#CCCCCC"> in order</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to increase your</font>

increase your mental capacity and focus

35
00:01:21,299 --> 00:01:26,610
and anything related to empowering other

36
00:01:24,659 --> 00:01:28,500
people right because<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's our mission</font>

37
00:01:26,609 --> 00:01:31,618
to become<font color="#CCCCCC"> the strongest version of</font>

38
00:01:28,500 --> 00:01:35,969
ourselves in order<font color="#E5E5E5"> to empower I also for</font>

39
00:01:31,618 --> 00:01:38,040
the first time taught my core values the

40
00:01:35,969 --> 00:01:41,429
strength camp core values we've got four

41
00:01:38,040 --> 00:01:43,770
strengthcamp core values<font color="#CCCCCC"> that were taken</font>

42
00:01:41,430 --> 00:01:45,840
I actually developed it for the new book

43
00:01:43,769 --> 00:01:47,879
that will be coming out my new book

44
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:50,399
titled<font color="#CCCCCC"> king that will be coming out</font>

45
00:01:47,879 --> 00:01:53,250
later this year but essentially I took

46
00:01:50,399 --> 00:01:55,879
the outline from the book and expanded

47
00:01:53,250 --> 00:01:58,049
on on upon it during<font color="#E5E5E5"> my presentation</font>

48
00:01:55,879 --> 00:02:00,149
specifically as it relates<font color="#E5E5E5"> to the</font>

49
00:01:58,049 --> 00:02:02,820
strength camp core values and that was

50
00:02:00,149 --> 00:02:05,399
<font color="#E5E5E5">really uh it was fun for</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> me</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to share and</font>

51
00:02:02,819 --> 00:02:07,199
like I said the participants really

52
00:02:05,399 --> 00:02:09,270
enjoyed it<font color="#E5E5E5"> the next thing</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that happened</font>

53
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:11,729

60
00:02:24,979 --> 00:02:29,959
start using that so we also we had

61
00:02:27,250 --> 00:02:31,908
Brandon Carter he and I chopped it up we

62
00:02:29,959 --> 00:02:34,340

63
00:02:31,908 --> 00:02:37,039
together we also had my buddy drew

Phoenix who is a wordsmith he dropped us

65
00:02:37,039 --> 00:02:47,239
with some real hardcore poetry

66
00:02:39,969 --> 00:02:51,348
particularly<font color="#E5E5E5"> with a spin that revolves</font>

67
00:02:47,239 --> 00:02:55,158
around being an ex-marine very powerful

68
00:02:51,348 --> 00:02:57,108
stuff so he offers poetry as his as a

69
00:02:55,158 --> 00:03:00,500
part of this in order<font color="#E5E5E5"> to relay his</font>

70
00:02:57,109 --> 00:03:02,959
experience as a as an ex-marine and

that I experienced this weekend it was

86
00:03:35,299 --> 00:03:40,400
kind of a<font color="#E5E5E5"> little la mystical if you will</font>

87
00:03:38,299 --> 00:03:42,680
but maybe I'm just superstitious I tend

88
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:45,349
to look into every experience of my life

89
00:03:42,680 --> 00:03:47,719
and give it significance so during the

90
00:03:45,348 --> 00:03:49,488
party<font color="#E5E5E5"> Saturday night I was of course</font>

91
00:03:47,719 --> 00:03:52,128

00:04:35,839 --> 00:04:40,188
course we<font color="#E5E5E5"> were dancing outside it went</font>

113
00:04:37,189 --> 00:04:41,449
inside looking at various tables<font color="#CCCCCC"> people</font>

114
00:04:40,189 --> 00:04:42,770
were standing at the tables looking at

115
00:04:41,449 --> 00:04:46,819
all the tables for napkins and I'm

116
00:04:42,769 --> 00:04:48,948
collecting napkins so I can ja but blot

117
00:04:46,819 --> 00:04:50,990
out all the sweat on my body and<font color="#CCCCCC"> I come</font>

118
00:04:48,949 --> 00:04:56,870
<font color="#E5E5E5">to one table and a gentleman is standing</font>

119
00:04:50,990 --> 00:04:59,800
there with a big white fluffy towel by

120
00:04:56,870 --> 00:05:02,629
the name of Jerry and<font color="#E5E5E5"> uh and our friend</font>

121
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:06,500
happen to own a company that makes

122
00:05:02,629 --> 00:05:10,009
towels that are a little nifty and he

123
00:05:06,500 --> 00:05:12,740
handed me his towel as a gift<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is a</font>

124
00:05:10,009 --> 00:05:14,750
child is a towel that I received as a

125
00:05:12,740 --> 00:05:18,918
gift right and war for the rest of the

126
00:05:14,750 --> 00:05:20,449
night as my part of my uniform I loved

127
00:05:18,918 --> 00:05:21,769
it<font color="#CCCCCC"> because I loved the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> gift so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> much so I</font>

128
00:05:20,449 --> 00:05:23,990
just<font color="#E5E5E5"> wore it for the rest of the night</font>

129
00:05:21,769 --> 00:05:26,778
but what makes this<font color="#E5E5E5"> towel unique is that</font>

130
00:05:23,990 --> 00:05:28,340
it has a little netting that<font color="#CCCCCC"> you could</font>

131
00:05:26,778 --> 00:05:29,778
put on top of your put over your seat

132
00:05:28,339 --> 00:05:31,638
when you go in the car so that you don't

133
00:05:29,778 --> 00:05:33,939
wet your car when you're all sweaty from

134
00:05:31,639 --> 00:05:37,699
the gym I thought<font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> was</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> ingenious and</font>

135
00:05:33,939 --> 00:05:40,218
and I was very<font color="#E5E5E5"> grateful to have had the</font>

136
00:05:37,699 --> 00:05:44,569
spontaneous manifestation of exactly

137
00:05:40,218 --> 00:05:47,449
what I needed and it wasn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> as mystical</font>

138
00:05:44,569 --> 00:05:50,210
as it sounds in fact myself in the young

139
00:05:47,449 --> 00:05:52,158
man Jeremy we exchanged emails several

140
00:05:50,209 --> 00:05:53,930
months ago where he asked me just<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

141
00:05:52,158 --> 00:05:56,629
sign up for his email list in order to

142
00:05:53,930 --> 00:05:57,829
help<font color="#CCCCCC"> him support some charity work that</font>

143
00:05:56,629 --> 00:06:00,770
I believe he was doing for his brother

144
00:05:57,829 --> 00:06:02,240
but anyway I'm pulling out<font color="#E5E5E5"> my wife my</font>

145
00:06:00,769 --> 00:06:06,348
