31
00:01:15,599 --> 00:01:19,589
<font color="#E5E5E5">probably a little bit more like Arsenio</font>

32
00:01:16,890 --> 00:01:22,530
Hall than Barbara Walters but I think

33
00:01:19,590 --> 00:01:26,759
you'll enjoy it either way so reflection

34
00:01:22,530 --> 00:01:29,609

39
00:01:35,069 --> 00:01:38,849
<font color="#E5E5E5">because I don't know fuck to say</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> cuz</font>

there's so much that's gone on I didn't

41
00:01:38,849 --> 00:01:42,298
know<font color="#E5E5E5"> where to begin and I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> think it might</font>

42
00:01:40,920 --> 00:01:44,670
take me a little while to get the ball

43
00:01:42,299 --> 00:01:47,070

46
00:01:48,629 --> 00:01:54,420
informative way but today is just gonna

47
00:01:50,459 --> 00:01:55,798
be a jumbled mishmash of my experiences

48
00:01:54,420 --> 00:01:58,920
over the past two<font color="#CCCCCC"> weeks cuz it's been</font>

YouTube videos I was broke but I had one

92
00:03:52,949 --> 00:03:56,429
thing in mind and one thing only and

93
00:03:54,629 --> 00:03:59,159
that was creating experiences for my

94
00:03:56,430 --> 00:04:01,200
family by not being able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to buy afford</font>

95
00:03:59,159 --> 00:04:04,739
to buy them really expensive things but

96
00:04:01,199 --> 00:04:06,119
I had the desire<font color="#CCCCCC"> to give them tremendous</font>

97
00:04:04,739 --> 00:04:08,489
experiences and one of those<font color="#E5E5E5"> experiences</font>

98
00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:10,019
I want to give them was to live outdoors

99
00:04:08,489 --> 00:04:12,419
for a little while my<font color="#E5E5E5"> parents grew up in</font>

100
00:04:10,019 --> 00:04:14,430
Belize so they kind of grew up outdoors

101
00:04:12,419 --> 00:04:18,478
dirt floors and shit like that so when<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

102
00:04:14,430 --> 00:04:20,819
grew up in New York and my neighbors and

256
00:10:34,879 --> 00:10:37,580
of becoming a stronger version of

257
00:10:36,049 --> 00:10:40,819

263
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:55,610
plethora of videos I've made almost to

264
00:10:54,200 --> 00:10:56,649
the point where some things i say

265
00:10:55,610 --> 00:10:57,759
