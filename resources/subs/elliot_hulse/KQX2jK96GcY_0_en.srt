2
00:00:02,419 --> 00:00:07,048
it's a it's a tough one<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's one that I</font>

3
00:00:04,799 --> 00:00:09,660
had to sit<font color="#CCCCCC"> and think about for a little</font>

4
00:00:07,049 --> 00:00:12,150
while before getting on camera lily has

5
00:00:09,660 --> 00:00:15,030
dated someone several years<font color="#E5E5E5"> ago who gave</font>

6
00:00:12,150 --> 00:00:17,460
her genital warts STD and this is not so

7
00:00:15,029 --> 00:00:19,169
uncommon you know STDs that they happen

8
00:00:17,460 --> 00:00:22,460
the thing is<font color="#CCCCCC"> that now Lily's still a</font>

9
00:00:19,170 --> 00:00:26,368
young girl and she is in a situation

10
00:00:22,460 --> 00:00:28,679
where she wants<font color="#CCCCCC"> to soften to a man she</font>

11
00:00:26,368 --> 00:00:34,308
wants<font color="#E5E5E5"> to give herself to a man she wants</font>

12
00:00:28,679 --> 00:00:38,128
to<font color="#CCCCCC"> have sex and it's very difficult</font>

13
00:00:34,308 --> 00:00:40,828
being dishonest about her STD she she

14
00:00:38,128 --> 00:00:43,378
she refuses<font color="#CCCCCC"> to do it and it goes so far</font>

15
00:00:40,829 --> 00:00:47,100
that she can't even come to kissing a

16
00:00:43,378 --> 00:00:49,589
man and there are men that she has warm

17
00:00:47,100 --> 00:00:51,390
feelings towards that tend to have<font color="#E5E5E5"> good</font>

18
00:00:49,590 --> 00:00:52,860
feelings toward her but the minute she

19
00:00:51,390 --> 00:00:55,230
brings up the conversation she knows

20
00:00:52,859 --> 00:00:58,409
exactly<font color="#E5E5E5"> what's going to happen next he</font>

21
00:00:55,229 --> 00:01:00,269
bounces and justifiably so if he

22
00:00:58,409 --> 00:01:02,009
realizes that like look<font color="#E5E5E5"> I don't want to</font>

00:01:00,270 --> 00:01:04,439
go any<font color="#CCCCCC"> further with this if I'm going to</font>

26
00:01:07,290 --> 00:01:11,909

you can't get rid of this virus

29
00:01:13,379 --> 00:01:18,989
apparently you want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to bring somebody in</font>

30

being without this scourge you want to

34
00:01:25,950 --> 00:01:30,000

the spiritual ideas typically in most

compassion is what you need compassion

understanding patience and love is what

129
00:05:41,110 --> 00:05:46,449
you need from another human being open

up the energetic pathway for that by

131
00:05:46,449 --> 00:05:51,728
doing it yourself and that's why I so

132
00:05:49,209 --> 00:05:54,728
strongly recommend<font color="#E5E5E5"> you go and find</font>

00:05:56,649 --> 00:06:01,209
you and could use your compassion

00:05:59,470 --> 00:06:05,470
because you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to find that</font>

137
00:06:01,209 --> 00:06:08,349
perhaps no there are no promises there

138
00:06:05,470 --> 00:06:11,770
are no promises but

139
00:06:08,350 --> 00:06:13,300
it's worth a try you're going to find

140

<font color="#CCCCCC">that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> when you extend yourself in that</font>
