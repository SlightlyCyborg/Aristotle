1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,819
a question<font color="#CCCCCC"> from</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> our buddy CJ who has</font>

2
00:00:02,520 --> 00:00:07,679
conflicting or seemingly conflicting

3
00:00:04,819 --> 00:00:09,839
passions so he's in school and he's

4
00:00:07,679 --> 00:00:12,269
studying how<font color="#E5E5E5"> to become a music producer</font>

5
00:00:09,839 --> 00:00:15,088
and he loves it with all of his heart he

6
00:00:12,269 --> 00:00:17,698
feels as if he's in his river as I would

7
00:00:15,089 --> 00:00:19,920
say when he's doing<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> music production</font>

8
00:00:17,699 --> 00:00:21,480
thing when he's producing his own music

9
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:24,300
when he's studying music everything

10
00:00:21,480 --> 00:00:26,730
associated with that he loves now he

11
00:00:24,300 --> 00:00:30,420
also started going outdoors and rock

12
00:00:26,730 --> 00:00:31,920
<font color="#CCCCCC">climbing and doing exercises in nature</font>

13
00:00:30,420 --> 00:00:33,870
essentially this is the way he describes

14
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:37,980
it says that I've been outdoors running

15
00:00:33,869 --> 00:00:41,099
and walking and hiking and I've grown to

16
00:00:37,979 --> 00:00:42,988
<font color="#CCCCCC">love the outdoor lifestyle associated</font>

17
00:00:41,100 --> 00:00:45,270
with doing all the things<font color="#E5E5E5"> that make my</font>

18
00:00:42,988 --> 00:00:48,269
body healthy and fit so he's got this

19
00:00:45,270 --> 00:00:50,820
fitness and outdoor passion as well as

20
00:00:48,270 --> 00:00:52,109
his music production passion and he

21
00:00:50,820 --> 00:00:55,109
feels as if they're at odds with each

22
00:00:52,109 --> 00:00:57,259
other and they're<font color="#E5E5E5"> really not but in his</font>

23
00:00:55,109 --> 00:01:00,448
mind he believes that<font color="#E5E5E5"> if he follows his</font>

24
00:00:57,259 --> 00:01:02,519
his dream and pursues music production

25
00:01:00,448 --> 00:01:03,988
he's going to end<font color="#E5E5E5"> up in a big city right</font>

26
00:01:02,520 --> 00:01:05,728
which I<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't know anything about music</font>

27
00:01:03,988 --> 00:01:07,438
production but perhaps perhaps he's

28
00:01:05,728 --> 00:01:09,569
right perhaps the situation is such that

29
00:01:07,438 --> 00:01:11,459
in order to fulfill his dream he's got

30
00:01:09,569 --> 00:01:13,019
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> make some sacrifices and that which</font>

31
00:01:11,459 --> 00:01:16,199
he<font color="#E5E5E5"> would</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> have to sacrifice in his mind</font>

32
00:01:13,019 --> 00:01:18,269
is his ability to<font color="#E5E5E5"> exercise outdoors in</font>

33
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:20,280
nature no I don't know<font color="#E5E5E5"> where you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> word is</font>

34
00:01:18,269 --> 00:01:22,438
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you live but I would</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> assume that</font>

35
00:01:20,280 --> 00:01:25,320
you could probably have both depending

36
00:01:22,438 --> 00:01:28,978
on where you live but the real question

37
00:01:25,319 --> 00:01:31,408
here is right because it goes beyond

38
00:01:28,978 --> 00:01:33,438
just the content here the the<font color="#E5E5E5"> context of</font>

39
00:01:31,409 --> 00:01:35,909
the question is how can you have both

40
00:01:33,438 --> 00:01:37,919
right and we tend<font color="#CCCCCC"> to live in a day and</font>

41
00:01:35,909 --> 00:01:40,259
age and people tend to tell us and

42
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:42,118
<font color="#E5E5E5">people have told me</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that you've got to</font>

43
00:01:40,259 --> 00:01:45,569
choose one or the other in many regards

44
00:01:42,118 --> 00:01:47,879
so for example I wanted a lifestyle

45
00:01:45,569 --> 00:01:49,828
where my wife stayed home with my

46
00:01:47,879 --> 00:01:52,019
children I wanted<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> have lots of</font>

47
00:01:49,828 --> 00:01:55,589
children I want<font color="#CCCCCC"> to spend lots of time</font>

48
00:01:52,019 --> 00:01:57,840
with my family my wife my children and I

49
00:01:55,590 --> 00:02:00,420
wanted<font color="#E5E5E5"> to build a business I wanted my</font>

50
00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:01,978
own gym and I wanted<font color="#CCCCCC"> to do what I'm</font>

51
00:02:00,420 --> 00:02:04,200
doing here through publishing ideas

52
00:02:01,978 --> 00:02:05,879
<font color="#CCCCCC">through the internet and it would it all</font>

53
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:09,750
seemed like the people that I shared

54
00:02:05,879 --> 00:02:11,400
this idea of having both with thought I

55
00:02:09,750 --> 00:02:12,810
was nuts well you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> what if you're</font>

56
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:14,610
going to build a big business and<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

57
00:02:12,810 --> 00:02:17,069
going to have<font color="#CCCCCC"> all these lofty goals with</font>

58
00:02:14,610 --> 00:02:19,260
regard to your career then your family

59
00:02:17,068 --> 00:02:20,969
is going to suffer or if you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to</font>

60
00:02:19,259 --> 00:02:23,159
be a family man that just realized<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

61
00:02:20,969 --> 00:02:25,050
you shouldn't have such high aspirations

62
00:02:23,159 --> 00:02:26,789
with regard to your your fitness

63
00:02:25,050 --> 00:02:27,810
business things of that nature and the

64
00:02:26,789 --> 00:02:29,689
same<font color="#CCCCCC"> thing as for you people</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> are going</font>

65
00:02:27,810 --> 00:02:32,610
to tell you what you<font color="#E5E5E5"> ought to choose</font>

66
00:02:29,689 --> 00:02:35,939
what I decided to do was take the advice

67
00:02:32,610 --> 00:02:37,260
<font color="#CCCCCC">of Dan Kennedy who's one of the sort of</font>

68
00:02:35,939 --> 00:02:40,019
<font color="#E5E5E5">a mentor to me because I read a lot of</font>

69
00:02:37,259 --> 00:02:41,639
his books and he said the very<font color="#E5E5E5"> first</font>

70
00:02:40,019 --> 00:02:43,469
thing you should do is design the type

71
00:02:41,639 --> 00:02:45,659
of lifestyle that you want to live first

72
00:02:43,469 --> 00:02:47,370
thing you<font color="#CCCCCC"> do don't figure</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> out what</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> kind</font>

73
00:02:45,659 --> 00:02:49,199
of business you<font color="#E5E5E5"> want don't decide</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> what</font>

74
00:02:47,370 --> 00:02:52,409
<font color="#E5E5E5">kind of career you want the first thing</font>

75
00:02:49,199 --> 00:02:54,899
you do is to choose your lifestyle down

76
00:02:52,409 --> 00:02:57,239
to the letter so essentially script your

77
00:02:54,900 --> 00:03:00,209
<font color="#E5E5E5">perfect day what it would look like yeah</font>

78
00:02:57,239 --> 00:03:01,769
what when you have everything as it

79
00:03:00,209 --> 00:03:03,120
should be and for<font color="#E5E5E5"> you it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> might sound</font>

80
00:03:01,769 --> 00:03:05,069
something like this get<font color="#E5E5E5"> up in the</font>

81
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:08,370
morning and walk out into my backyard

82
00:03:05,068 --> 00:03:10,798
and go hiking for an hour come home into

83
00:03:08,370 --> 00:03:15,120
<font color="#E5E5E5">the basement studio that I've produced</font>

84
00:03:10,799 --> 00:03:16,829
that is building remote audiences

85
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:18,480
throughout the world and artists are

86
00:03:16,829 --> 00:03:20,909
coming to to me through the internet

87
00:03:18,479 --> 00:03:23,340
through this thing in<font color="#E5E5E5"> my house that's</font>

88
00:03:20,909 --> 00:03:25,379
located on their<font color="#E5E5E5"> mountain in nature</font>

89
00:03:23,340 --> 00:03:27,599
somewhere you see now that may have

90
00:03:25,379 --> 00:03:29,669
<font color="#CCCCCC">never been done that idea may have never</font>

91
00:03:27,599 --> 00:03:31,620
<font color="#E5E5E5">been presented to you but that's</font>

92
00:03:29,669 --> 00:03:33,899
<font color="#E5E5E5">something you can create the problem is</font>

93
00:03:31,620 --> 00:03:35,189
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> we when we start imagining the</font>

94
00:03:33,900 --> 00:03:36,629
things that we would<font color="#E5E5E5"> like</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to have done</font>

95
00:03:35,189 --> 00:03:39,000
<font color="#E5E5E5">especially if it hasn't been</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> done before</font>

96
00:03:36,629 --> 00:03:40,469
we don't know anybody who's done that we

97
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:43,349
start saying out it's impossible that

98
00:03:40,469 --> 00:03:45,120
<font color="#E5E5E5">can't be done right there's no way that</font>

99
00:03:43,349 --> 00:03:48,329
this could happen<font color="#E5E5E5"> it goes against the</font>

100
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:50,310
way it's traditionally done and what I'm

101
00:03:48,329 --> 00:03:53,069
inviting you to do is to<font color="#E5E5E5"> ignore that</font>

102
00:03:50,310 --> 00:03:56,939
completely and become so enthralled with

103
00:03:53,068 --> 00:03:58,888
this idea of having both that as you

104
00:03:56,939 --> 00:04:02,519
navigate your life you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to find</font>

105
00:03:58,889 --> 00:04:05,670
that opportunities show up and you're

106
00:04:02,519 --> 00:04:07,109
<font color="#CCCCCC">going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to have the strength and the</font>

107
00:04:05,669 --> 00:04:09,449
courage and the conviction and the

108
00:04:07,109 --> 00:04:10,859
commitment to do certain<font color="#CCCCCC"> things and make</font>

109
00:04:09,449 --> 00:04:13,259
<font color="#E5E5E5">certain choices that will ultimately</font>

110
00:04:10,859 --> 00:04:14,189
lead to you having the life that you

111
00:04:13,259 --> 00:04:16,469
<font color="#CCCCCC">want and you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> know people are going to</font>

112
00:04:14,189 --> 00:04:18,569
say you're lucky people are going to

113
00:04:16,470 --> 00:04:20,280
tell you that you're lucky<font color="#E5E5E5"> that you that</font>

114
00:04:18,569 --> 00:04:22,500
<font color="#CCCCCC">you have these</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> things you're lucky that</font>

115
00:04:20,279 --> 00:04:25,169
things worked out the way they did they

116
00:04:22,500 --> 00:04:27,209
is now you have both where most people

117
00:04:25,170 --> 00:04:29,939
have chosen<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be a slave to one</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> or the</font>

118
00:04:27,209 --> 00:04:33,689
other or for some reason in their life

119
00:04:29,939 --> 00:04:35,610
they're not fully satisfied you didn't

120
00:04:33,689 --> 00:04:38,519
you're a bit more lucky than those

121
00:04:35,610 --> 00:04:41,370
<font color="#E5E5E5">people what they won't realize is that</font>

122
00:04:38,519 --> 00:04:44,370
you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> living on purpose you're creating</font>

123
00:04:41,370 --> 00:04:47,399
a vision for yourself and that vision is

124
00:04:44,370 --> 00:04:49,319
coming true regardless of what other

125
00:04:47,399 --> 00:04:51,839
people say or whether or not it's been

126
00:04:49,319 --> 00:04:55,560
done<font color="#CCCCCC"> before</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you design your lifestyle</font>

127
00:04:51,839 --> 00:04:57,060
first and the design<font color="#CCCCCC"> the structure</font>

128
00:04:55,560 --> 00:04:59,959
around which you will<font color="#E5E5E5"> bring it forth</font>

129
00:04:57,060 --> 00:04:59,959
good luck
