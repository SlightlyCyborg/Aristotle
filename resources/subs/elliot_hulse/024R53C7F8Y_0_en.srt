and forth between each of them I'm

7
00:00:14,339 --> 00:00:20,789
realizing just how much a parent wants

8
00:00:18,570 --> 00:00:24,118
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> give each one of their children you</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">know one has such great potential in one</font>

area that if<font color="#E5E5E5"> given the opportunity a</font>

words really<font color="#E5E5E5"> give everything that that</font>

13
00:00:32,098 --> 00:00:36,959
parent has to offer in order to help

14
00:00:35,429 --> 00:00:41,670
develop<font color="#E5E5E5"> the child in</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that particular way</font>

15
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:43,230
right and that character that those

16
00:00:41,670 --> 00:00:45,210
virtues that you could<font color="#E5E5E5"> help develop in</font>

17
00:00:43,229 --> 00:00:47,429
that child<font color="#CCCCCC"> may be very different than</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">the ones that you helped develop and the</font>

very<font color="#E5E5E5"> different</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and very very gifted in</font>

24
00:00:55,890 --> 00:01:01,350
their own ways a sense of guilt comes

25
00:00:59,308 --> 00:01:03,000
over me and I'm sure comes over other

26
00:01:01,350 --> 00:01:04,379
parents or if you're thinking of having

27
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:09,118
children these<font color="#CCCCCC"> are things that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you may</font>

28

experience where by you would like to

00:01:09,118 --> 00:01:13,069
offer everything that you have as a

30
00:01:11,159 --> 00:01:15,750
parent one hundred percent of yourself

31
00:01:13,069 --> 00:01:18,179
towards the development of the virtues

00:01:15,750 --> 00:01:20,040
<font color="#E5E5E5">and the talents and the gifts and the</font>

the time to give one<font color="#E5E5E5"> hundred percent to</font>

00:01:56,849 --> 00:02:04,039
stories I mean just trying on different

50
00:02:00,590 --> 00:02:08,280
positions or paradigms that may prove

51
00:02:04,040 --> 00:02:09,689
resourceful in getting through these

these different types<font color="#E5E5E5"> of challenges and</font>

they are not<font color="#CCCCCC"> mine first I am simply a</font>

67
00:02:48,409 --> 00:02:57,379
facilitator of their development in the

68
00:02:52,169 --> 00:03:04,139
same way that a nature is actually what

69
00:02:57,379 --> 00:03:08,039
creates develops cultivates animals

70
00:03:04,139 --> 00:03:12,889
nature trees foliage to everything in

71
00:03:08,039 --> 00:03:16,229
the world right including us but the

72
00:03:12,889 --> 00:03:19,409
root organism through which the fruit

73
00:03:16,229 --> 00:03:20,759
comes you know the tree the parent

74
00:03:19,409 --> 00:03:23,549
through which the child proceeds is

75
00:03:20,759 --> 00:03:28,109
merely a facilitator is there to support

76
00:03:23,550 --> 00:03:30,120
what<font color="#CCCCCC"> God is doing</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> in the creation of</font>

77
00:03:28,110 --> 00:03:31,440
<font color="#E5E5E5">these children or in the the making of</font>

00:03:30,120 --> 00:03:35,759
these<font color="#E5E5E5"> children or in the creation of</font>

79
00:03:31,439 --> 00:03:38,550
these plants and and fruits so there<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

80
00:03:35,759 --> 00:03:40,289
a there's a bit of relief in that it is

81
00:03:38,550 --> 00:03:41,880
not all our responsibility in fact it's

82
00:03:40,289 --> 00:03:44,340
quite narcissistic for us to believe

83
00:03:41,879 --> 00:03:47,009
<font color="#E5E5E5">that it's up to us to make</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> sure that our</font>

84
00:03:44,340 --> 00:03:49,710
children are so and so because a lot of

85
00:03:47,009 --> 00:03:51,780
our drive towards developing them in a

86
00:03:49,710 --> 00:03:54,990
particular way that we see as

87
00:03:51,780 --> 00:03:58,979
resourceful or that we are attached<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

88
00:03:54,990 --> 00:04:01,620
is uh is is neurotic you know my oldest

89
00:03:58,979 --> 00:04:03,810
daughter is<font color="#CCCCCC"> quote/unquote gifted right</font>

90
00:04:01,620 --> 00:04:05,879
so I want to<font color="#CCCCCC"> give</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> everything that I can</font>

91
00:04:03,810 --> 00:04:08,129
to developing her intellectual

92
00:04:05,879 --> 00:04:10,859
giftedness but I realize a big part of

93
00:04:08,129 --> 00:04:13,139
my drive to forcing her into becoming

94
00:04:10,860 --> 00:04:16,500
all that she could<font color="#E5E5E5"> be with regard to</font>

95
00:04:13,139 --> 00:04:20,539
intellect is a manifestation of my

96
00:04:16,500 --> 00:04:23,399
neurosis about being labeled as an a.d.d

97
00:04:20,540 --> 00:04:25,260
kid that has<font color="#E5E5E5"> learning disabilities yeah</font>

98
00:04:23,399 --> 00:04:27,689
I was labeled as stupid there's a

99
00:04:25,259 --> 00:04:31,199
fucking kid so it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> like I've got a pro</font>

100
00:04:27,689 --> 00:04:32,969
move that I'm not stupid because look at

101
00:04:31,199 --> 00:04:36,899
how brilliant my daughter is<font color="#E5E5E5"> fucking</font>

102
00:04:32,970 --> 00:04:39,120
narcissistic and neurotic and I have to

103
00:04:36,899 --> 00:04:42,359
see this and the most resourceful

104
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:44,509
position is to facilitate that which God

105
00:04:42,360 --> 00:04:47,310
<font color="#CCCCCC">is doing through her be there to support</font>

106
00:04:44,509 --> 00:04:49,949
what God is doing through each<font color="#CCCCCC"> one of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> my</font>

107
00:04:47,310 --> 00:04:53,160
<font color="#E5E5E5">children but not be attached to making</font>

108
00:04:49,949 --> 00:04:56,099
it happen right that relieves so much

109
00:04:53,160 --> 00:04:57,840
pressure<font color="#CCCCCC"> relief so much guilt and in i</font>

110
00:04:56,100 --> 00:04:59,460
believe<font color="#CCCCCC"> and all this is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> just an</font>

111
00:04:57,839 --> 00:05:02,069
experiment to me so everything that<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

112
00:04:59,459 --> 00:05:05,699
come<font color="#E5E5E5"> up</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> with check back with me in five</font>

113
00:05:02,069 --> 00:05:09,000
years<font color="#E5E5E5"> yeah this shit works out I believe</font>

114
00:05:05,699 --> 00:05:10,979
<font color="#CCCCCC">that it's a it's far more beneficial to</font>

115
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:12,629
not only the parents to relieve them of

116
00:05:10,980 --> 00:05:16,879
the guilt of not being able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to make</font>

117
00:05:12,629 --> 00:05:19,500
<font color="#E5E5E5">their children superstars but also it</font>

118
00:05:16,879 --> 00:05:21,870
relieves the pressure from<font color="#E5E5E5"> the child to</font>

119
00:05:19,500 --> 00:05:25,470
living up to the expectations of what

120
00:05:21,870 --> 00:05:33,509
the world through the parent has imposed

121
00:05:25,470 --> 00:05:41,280
upon them let them<font color="#E5E5E5"> be let them grow into</font>

122
00:05:33,509 --> 00:05:43,259
<font color="#CCCCCC">what nature is doing in them and just be</font>

123
00:05:41,279 --> 00:05:45,619
<font color="#E5E5E5">there to facilitate and support that</font>

124
00:05:43,259 --> 00:05:45,620
process
