1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,580
so this weekend<font color="#E5E5E5"> I will be babysitting my</font>

2
00:00:03,419 --> 00:00:08,150
wife hates<font color="#CCCCCC"> when I say that but watching</font>

3
00:00:05,580 --> 00:00:10,259
all four of my children my youngest

4
00:00:08,150 --> 00:00:12,210
<font color="#E5E5E5">Benjamin he'll be two next month and</font>

5
00:00:10,259 --> 00:00:13,439
<font color="#CCCCCC">Isabel's my oldest seven so you could</font>

6
00:00:12,210 --> 00:00:15,839
imagine I've got my hands full for the

7
00:00:13,439 --> 00:00:17,730
next couple<font color="#E5E5E5"> days anyway Ben and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I are</font>

8
00:00:15,839 --> 00:00:19,920
outside we're playing and he's got this

9
00:00:17,730 --> 00:00:22,500
new phrase that he uses he goes under

10
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:25,529
<font color="#CCCCCC">under</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> he whines and points at things and</font>

11
00:00:22,500 --> 00:00:28,050
says uh not<font color="#E5E5E5"> uh not basically saying I</font>

12
00:00:25,528 --> 00:00:30,390
want that now this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> interesting</font>

13
00:00:28,050 --> 00:00:34,590
because he has<font color="#E5E5E5"> just made a gigantic</font>

14
00:00:30,390 --> 00:00:35,730
evolutionary jump in his<font color="#E5E5E5"> uh in his</font>

15
00:00:34,590 --> 00:00:37,350
development in a psychological

16
00:00:35,729 --> 00:00:41,069
development because prior to this point

17
00:00:37,350 --> 00:00:44,670
there was no that right this is the<font color="#E5E5E5"> way</font>

18
00:00:41,070 --> 00:00:46,980
human beings<font color="#E5E5E5"> evolved prior to his</font>

19
00:00:44,670 --> 00:00:49,439
understanding of recognizing which is a

20
00:00:46,979 --> 00:00:53,429
better way of describing it the concept

21
00:00:49,439 --> 00:00:56,549
<font color="#E5E5E5">of duality everything was one to him the</font>

22
00:00:53,429 --> 00:00:58,439
where he how he was fed where he came

23
00:00:56,549 --> 00:01:00,718
from and all the<font color="#CCCCCC"> things have been in his</font>

24
00:00:58,439 --> 00:01:03,539
environment had a oneness to<font color="#E5E5E5"> it right</font>

25
00:01:00,719 --> 00:01:06,599
but now he's experimenting with and and

26
00:01:03,539 --> 00:01:10,260
using the tool of duality and in that

27
00:01:06,599 --> 00:01:12,449
there is<font color="#CCCCCC"> a separation between him and</font>

28
00:01:10,260 --> 00:01:15,060
the external<font color="#CCCCCC"> environment which creates</font>

29
00:01:12,450 --> 00:01:18,240
tension right because there's a wanting

30
00:01:15,060 --> 00:01:19,560
now there's me there's that and then

31
00:01:18,239 --> 00:01:21,868
there's separation between me and that

32
00:01:19,560 --> 00:01:24,060
<font color="#E5E5E5">and now I have wanting which creates</font>

33
00:01:21,868 --> 00:01:28,859
anxiety that's why he whines when he

34
00:01:24,060 --> 00:01:30,868
says I'm not<font color="#E5E5E5"> undines right so this is a</font>

35
00:01:28,859 --> 00:01:35,640
<font color="#E5E5E5">very critical</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> junction for us as parents</font>

36
00:01:30,868 --> 00:01:40,289
because if we don't continue to allow

37
00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:43,469
him to feel rooted in his in his in his

38
00:01:40,290 --> 00:01:47,909
body essentially him getting all of his

39
00:01:43,469 --> 00:01:50,429
needs met he's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to remove or</font>

40
00:01:47,909 --> 00:01:53,189
displace the frame of reference from his

41
00:01:50,430 --> 00:01:57,860
body from himself<font color="#CCCCCC"> and place it on the</font>

42
00:01:53,188 --> 00:02:00,898
external so there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to be a from</font>

43
00:01:57,859 --> 00:02:02,849
having<font color="#E5E5E5"> all my needs met ie my mom is</font>

44
00:02:00,899 --> 00:02:05,159
still nursing me i'm still getting love

45
00:02:02,849 --> 00:02:06,959
<font color="#E5E5E5">and that's really the essence of it it's</font>

46
00:02:05,159 --> 00:02:08,670
it's the nursing that<font color="#E5E5E5"> his mother's still</font>

47
00:02:06,959 --> 00:02:10,368
providing him with because he's still

48
00:02:08,669 --> 00:02:13,639
getting psychological

49
00:02:10,368 --> 00:02:16,400
and nutritional nourishing from his

50
00:02:13,639 --> 00:02:19,818
route from from the ground essentially

51
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:21,890
from which he sprung from right and if

52
00:02:19,818 --> 00:02:23,179
<font color="#E5E5E5">we sever that tie too early there's</font>

53
00:02:21,889 --> 00:02:27,738
<font color="#E5E5E5">going to be there's going to be a</font>

54
00:02:23,180 --> 00:02:30,280
displacement from his understanding that

55
00:02:27,739 --> 00:02:34,189
needs shall be met and should be met to

56
00:02:30,280 --> 00:02:36,739
I want<font color="#E5E5E5"> that to external frame of</font>

57
00:02:34,189 --> 00:02:41,180
reference I need I i want i want<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

58
00:02:36,739 --> 00:02:45,489
it's no longer<font color="#E5E5E5"> me getting my needs met</font>

59
00:02:41,180 --> 00:02:51,500
<font color="#CCCCCC">it's i need to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to fulfill this anxiety</font>

60
00:02:45,489 --> 00:02:54,500
by placing my interest and my energy<font color="#CCCCCC"> on</font>

61
00:02:51,500 --> 00:02:56,299
obtaining that which<font color="#CCCCCC"> is separate from me</font>

62
00:02:54,500 --> 00:02:58,969
and then<font color="#CCCCCC"> that lands you into a place</font>

63
00:02:56,299 --> 00:03:01,010
where most of us are most of<font color="#E5E5E5"> us are in</font>

64
00:02:58,969 --> 00:03:04,340
that place where we are<font color="#E5E5E5"> constantly</font>

65
00:03:01,009 --> 00:03:08,539
looking<font color="#E5E5E5"> to fulfill this perceived need</font>

66
00:03:04,340 --> 00:03:10,878
bye-bye really trying by really just

67
00:03:08,539 --> 00:03:12,828
going about going after our wants right

68
00:03:10,878 --> 00:03:14,298
because<font color="#CCCCCC"> needs</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> weren't met right for the</font>

69
00:03:12,829 --> 00:03:16,430
majority<font color="#E5E5E5"> of us with living in Western</font>

70
00:03:14,299 --> 00:03:18,379
civilization needs weren't<font color="#E5E5E5"> met when we</font>

71
00:03:16,430 --> 00:03:20,359
were when we r inference you know within

72
00:03:18,379 --> 00:03:22,159
a society in the time in a place where

73
00:03:20,359 --> 00:03:23,480
children weren't breastfed to any great

74
00:03:22,159 --> 00:03:26,750
degree<font color="#E5E5E5"> probably the past three</font>

75
00:03:23,479 --> 00:03:29,119
generations or so you know pet<font color="#E5E5E5"> mothers</font>

76
00:03:26,750 --> 00:03:30,859
started going to work so needs<font color="#E5E5E5"> weren't</font>

77
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:32,419
met for young children and they still

78
00:03:30,859 --> 00:03:34,129
aren't to any great degree but<font color="#CCCCCC"> I feel</font>

79
00:03:32,419 --> 00:03:37,730
there's an evolution going on so where

80
00:03:34,128 --> 00:03:39,798
most of us are is we place all of<font color="#CCCCCC"> our</font>

81
00:03:37,729 --> 00:03:44,810
value we place all<font color="#CCCCCC"> of our energy on the</font>

82
00:03:39,799 --> 00:03:48,409
on the obtaining of things I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> not I'm</font>

83
00:03:44,810 --> 00:03:50,769
not want<font color="#CCCCCC"> that I want that I want that so</font>

breast feeding your children so that

87
00:03:55,128 --> 00:03:59,719
their psychological not just their

88
00:03:56,959 --> 00:04:01,699
physical needs are met and don't sever

89
00:03:59,719 --> 00:04:03,620
that tie i invite you to to commit

90
00:04:01,699 --> 00:04:06,199
before you have<font color="#E5E5E5"> children</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that way you're</font>

91
00:04:03,620 --> 00:04:08,239
really grounded in that idea<font color="#CCCCCC"> that i'm</font>

92
00:04:06,199 --> 00:04:09,859
going to<font color="#CCCCCC"> fulfill all of my child's</font>

psychological about you I'm sorry

children in a world that's constantly

99
00:04:23,110 --> 00:04:28,900
I'm not I'm not I'm not focused while

100
00:04:27,610 --> 00:04:32,189
<font color="#E5E5E5">everybody's running around none of their</font>

00:04:28,899 --> 00:04:34,299
meat needs met everyone's malnourished

102

said what
