00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,230
hey whats up guys today's daily post was

2
00:00:02,040 --> 00:00:05,730
about how to train with limitations our

3
00:00:04,230 --> 00:00:08,820
friend asked a question about how to

4
00:00:05,730 --> 00:00:10,469
continue to<font color="#E5E5E5"> grow</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> his upper body stronger</font>

5
00:00:08,820 --> 00:00:12,690
with bench presses overhead press and

6
00:00:10,468 --> 00:00:15,329
<font color="#CCCCCC">what not but</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> he's got a shoulder problem</font>

7
00:00:12,689 --> 00:00:18,118
that limits his range of motion so I

8
00:00:15,330 --> 00:00:19,710
spoke in terms<font color="#E5E5E5"> of how to improve his</font>

9
00:00:18,118 --> 00:00:20,939
physical strength in the article if you

10
00:00:19,710 --> 00:00:22,980
<font color="#E5E5E5">want</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to read it it's down below but</font>

11
00:00:20,939 --> 00:00:25,410
today in this video I want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to talk about</font>

12
00:00:22,980 --> 00:00:28,010
embracing your<font color="#E5E5E5"> limitations so obviously</font>

13
00:00:25,410 --> 00:00:33,750
our friend has a physical limitation and

14
00:00:28,010 --> 00:00:35,969
those are unknowable Ryan I mean if

15
00:00:33,750 --> 00:00:37,799
someone pokes my eye on me<font color="#CCCCCC"> and I can't</font>

16
00:00:35,969 --> 00:00:39,539
<font color="#E5E5E5">ignore the limitation the fact that i</font>

17
00:00:37,799 --> 00:00:41,429
don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> have an</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> eyeball there it's very</font>

18
00:00:39,539 --> 00:00:44,000
<font color="#E5E5E5">evident to me</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and my performance in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

19
00:00:41,429 --> 00:00:46,619
people around me so we can't sort of

20
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:49,079
sneak around them but we've got these

21
00:00:46,619 --> 00:00:52,099
insidious little strange limitations

22
00:00:49,079 --> 00:00:56,308
that i'm going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to call brick walls and</font>

23
00:00:52,100 --> 00:00:59,579
shadows in our lives that tend to well

24
00:00:56,308 --> 00:01:03,119
get in our way like a brick wall or keep

25
00:00:59,579 --> 00:01:06,269
us ignorant like<font color="#E5E5E5"> a shadow or</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> something</font>

26
00:01:03,119 --> 00:01:08,280
that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the dark so in terms of</font>

27
00:01:06,269 --> 00:01:11,789
limitations i tend to<font color="#E5E5E5"> look at them as</font>

28
00:01:08,280 --> 00:01:14,430
teaching tools so in the article<font color="#CCCCCC"> that i</font>

29
00:01:11,790 --> 00:01:17,250
referenced down below<font color="#CCCCCC"> i talked to my</font>

30
00:01:14,430 --> 00:01:19,409
friend about how although he's limited

31
00:01:17,250 --> 00:01:22,709
in his range of motion he<font color="#E5E5E5"> could continue</font>

32
00:01:19,409 --> 00:01:25,618
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> get stronger by working around it</font>

33
00:01:22,709 --> 00:01:28,709
right well the same thing<font color="#CCCCCC"> goes with the</font>

34
00:01:25,618 --> 00:01:32,159
limitations<font color="#E5E5E5"> in our character and our</font>

35
00:01:28,709 --> 00:01:35,309
lifestyle in our career and our

36
00:01:32,159 --> 00:01:37,590
relationships in our being there are

37
00:01:35,310 --> 00:01:39,420
going to be brick walls and they<font color="#E5E5E5"> were</font>

38
00:01:37,590 --> 00:01:42,030
going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> be shadows and when dealing</font>

39
00:01:39,420 --> 00:01:45,329
with<font color="#E5E5E5"> those limitations realizing that</font>

40
00:01:42,030 --> 00:01:46,618
they're designed for our ascension every

41
00:01:45,328 --> 00:01:48,809
<font color="#E5E5E5">single limitation that you have is</font>

42
00:01:46,618 --> 00:01:52,078
designed to make you a bit stronger

43
00:01:48,810 --> 00:01:54,868
either by teaching<font color="#E5E5E5"> you how to move over</font>

44
00:01:52,078 --> 00:01:57,239
around or through a brick wall or

45
00:01:54,868 --> 00:02:00,840
shedding light becoming enlightened

46
00:01:57,239 --> 00:02:04,949
about your shadows or things that you're

47
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:07,259
quite frankly ignoring or rather<font color="#CCCCCC"> not</font>

48
00:02:04,950 --> 00:02:09,929
look at right there are parts of us

49
00:02:07,259 --> 00:02:12,000
there are things going on inside us

50
00:02:09,929 --> 00:02:14,580
mentally physiologically that

51
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:16,069
quite frankly don't wanna admit right

52
00:02:14,580 --> 00:02:18,540
some of us got<font color="#E5E5E5"> the weird little</font>

53
00:02:16,069 --> 00:02:20,810
illnesses<font color="#CCCCCC"> you know and we're too afraid</font>

54
00:02:18,539 --> 00:02:23,060
to go to<font color="#E5E5E5"> the doctor to talk</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> about</font>

55
00:02:20,810 --> 00:02:26,969
sometimes<font color="#E5E5E5"> we have a recurring problem</font>

56
00:02:23,060 --> 00:02:29,310
perhaps with<font color="#CCCCCC"> the opposite sex I you know</font>

57
00:02:26,969 --> 00:02:32,370
27 years old and<font color="#CCCCCC"> I can't keep</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> up a</font>

58
00:02:29,310 --> 00:02:34,409
normal relationship with<font color="#CCCCCC"> a woman same</font>

59
00:02:32,370 --> 00:02:36,719
thing with<font color="#E5E5E5"> Jeff jobs and things like</font>

60
00:02:34,409 --> 00:02:40,680
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> so we tend to kind of play them</font>

61
00:02:36,719 --> 00:02:42,389
down play them off people would say but

62
00:02:40,680 --> 00:02:45,480
there's no way<font color="#CCCCCC"> to grow stronger when you</font>

63
00:02:42,389 --> 00:02:50,129
play them off so today we're going to

64
00:02:45,479 --> 00:02:55,199
talk about going through over around

65
00:02:50,129 --> 00:02:58,199
brick walls with<font color="#CCCCCC"> the principle of figure</font>

66
00:02:55,199 --> 00:03:01,319
it out<font color="#CCCCCC"> a bonus you've got to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> figure shit</font>

67
00:02:58,199 --> 00:03:02,969
out these walls are set there for you

68
00:03:01,319 --> 00:03:05,669
either physically physiologically

69
00:03:02,969 --> 00:03:08,099
energetically in your life because<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

70
00:03:05,669 --> 00:03:11,189
got to figure some shit out good friend

71
00:03:08,099 --> 00:03:15,150
of<font color="#CCCCCC"> mine Dave rule says that successful</font>

72
00:03:11,189 --> 00:03:16,620
people bigger shit out don't look at

73
00:03:15,150 --> 00:03:18,989
your limitation or look at that

74
00:03:16,620 --> 00:03:20,849
roadblock or look at that brick wall<font color="#E5E5E5"> in</font>

75
00:03:18,989 --> 00:03:23,280
front of you as something<font color="#CCCCCC"> to be upset</font>

76
00:03:20,849 --> 00:03:25,739
about<font color="#E5E5E5"> something to cry and whine</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> about</font>

77
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:28,340
something to fucking complain about like

78
00:03:25,739 --> 00:03:33,330
most people look at it<font color="#CCCCCC"> as an opportunity</font>

79
00:03:28,340 --> 00:03:34,620
a chance to<font color="#E5E5E5"> grow stronger some of the</font>

80
00:03:33,330 --> 00:03:39,090
ways that we<font color="#CCCCCC"> could potentially grow</font>

81
00:03:34,620 --> 00:03:41,849
stronger given a limitation right would

82
00:03:39,090 --> 00:03:44,159
<font color="#E5E5E5">be someone who goes blind right</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> now I</font>

83
00:03:41,849 --> 00:03:45,870
have absolutely no reference for this so

84
00:03:44,159 --> 00:03:48,930
anybody who's listening<font color="#CCCCCC"> to this who's</font>

85
00:03:45,870 --> 00:03:50,989
blind forgive me but I would<font color="#CCCCCC"> imagine</font>

86
00:03:48,930 --> 00:03:54,930
that someone who is blind and cannot see

87
00:03:50,989 --> 00:03:57,629
how is a limitation that forces you to

88
00:03:54,930 --> 00:04:01,469
grow stronger elsewhere right like with

89
00:03:57,629 --> 00:04:05,189
your fingers someone who can't see reads

90
00:04:01,469 --> 00:04:07,079
with Braille I see the Braille bumps on

91
00:04:05,189 --> 00:04:08,939
the wall when I'm at the you know

92
00:04:07,079 --> 00:04:11,459
<font color="#CCCCCC">doctor's office or</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> at an apartment</font>

93
00:04:08,939 --> 00:04:12,539
building somewhere you're supposed to

94
00:04:11,459 --> 00:04:15,659
touch it it supposed<font color="#E5E5E5"> to tell you where</font>

95
00:04:12,539 --> 00:04:17,909
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> are but fuck I barely can even feel</font>

96
00:04:15,659 --> 00:04:20,969
them they're<font color="#CCCCCC"> so tiny and they're</font>

97
00:04:17,910 --> 00:04:22,229
supposed<font color="#CCCCCC"> to be symbolic of something</font>

98
00:04:20,970 --> 00:04:24,300
you're like I'm supposed to touch a

99
00:04:22,228 --> 00:04:24,649
couple fucking dots on the wall and that

100
00:04:24,300 --> 00:04:28,879
should

101
00:04:24,649 --> 00:04:33,138
most me know my<font color="#E5E5E5"> seventh floor right so</font>

102
00:04:28,879 --> 00:04:36,379
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> gotta learn tactile abilities you've</font>

103
00:04:33,139 --> 00:04:39,288
got to create brand-new motor pathways I

104
00:04:36,379 --> 00:04:41,659
say motor but brain pathways<font color="#E5E5E5"> I was</font>

105
00:04:39,288 --> 00:04:44,149
talking<font color="#CCCCCC"> about the body so I say motor</font>

106
00:04:41,660 --> 00:04:47,449
but pathways in your brain so that when

107
00:04:44,149 --> 00:04:50,120
you touch the button the bumps on the

108
00:04:47,449 --> 00:04:52,129
wall you become enlightened you come

109
00:04:50,120 --> 00:04:54,769
aware right you go from being<font color="#E5E5E5"> in</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

110
00:04:52,129 --> 00:04:56,329
shadows darkness to light so you're

111
00:04:54,769 --> 00:04:59,269
forced to increase your tactile

112
00:04:56,329 --> 00:05:00,740
sensitivity this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> just one very</font>

113
00:04:59,269 --> 00:05:03,439
obvious example of course you know

114
00:05:00,740 --> 00:05:06,168
someone who's in a wheelchair I can't

115
00:05:03,439 --> 00:05:07,969
run well guess what there are guys<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

116
00:05:06,168 --> 00:05:10,069
play<font color="#E5E5E5"> basketball in their fucking</font>

117
00:05:07,970 --> 00:05:11,750
wheelchairs they played they play all

118
00:05:10,069 --> 00:05:14,269
kinds of games rolling around like this

119
00:05:11,750 --> 00:05:16,189
<font color="#E5E5E5">doing this you know what happens their</font>

120
00:05:14,269 --> 00:05:17,478
arms have to<font color="#CCCCCC"> get stronger now if they're</font>

121
00:05:16,189 --> 00:05:20,240
whining and complaining because the

122
00:05:17,478 --> 00:05:21,800
accident took their legs they'll remain

123
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:23,810
trapped in the level of consciousness

124
00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:25,220
and with the level<font color="#E5E5E5"> of lifestyle that</font>

125
00:05:23,810 --> 00:05:29,598
they<font color="#E5E5E5"> currently have but if they're at</font>

126
00:05:25,220 --> 00:05:32,210
aware person who is blessed with a

127
00:05:29,598 --> 00:05:34,219
limitation they'll see that it's an

128
00:05:32,209 --> 00:05:36,019
<font color="#CCCCCC">opportunity to grow stronger elsewhere</font>

129
00:05:34,220 --> 00:05:39,020
and maybe that's the best thing for<font color="#CCCCCC"> us</font>

130
00:05:36,019 --> 00:05:40,579
right oftentimes the things that we

131
00:05:39,019 --> 00:05:43,668
don't get are the things that<font color="#E5E5E5"> are taken</font>

132
00:05:40,579 --> 00:05:45,469
<font color="#CCCCCC">away from us are for our own good who</font>

133
00:05:43,668 --> 00:05:48,918
knows God's plan for your<font color="#E5E5E5"> souls</font>

134
00:05:45,470 --> 00:05:52,639
progression right so don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> judge just</font>

135
00:05:48,918 --> 00:05:57,500
figure it out the other thing has to do

136
00:05:52,639 --> 00:06:01,629
with shadows shadows are limitations

137
00:05:57,500 --> 00:06:05,360
that we're not willing to look at and

138
00:06:01,629 --> 00:06:07,158
many<font color="#E5E5E5"> times or not even aware of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> they're</font>

139
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:10,550
completely unconscious their ways of

140
00:06:07,158 --> 00:06:14,209
being in and attitudes that we adopt

141
00:06:10,550 --> 00:06:16,788
over time in<font color="#E5E5E5"> order to defend ourselves</font>

142
00:06:14,209 --> 00:06:19,209
from the<font color="#CCCCCC"> environment in order to protect</font>

143
00:06:16,788 --> 00:06:21,740
ourselves and in threatening

144
00:06:19,209 --> 00:06:24,109
circumstances in order to hold<font color="#E5E5E5"> ourselves</font>

145
00:06:21,740 --> 00:06:29,478
high in an environment where perhaps we

146

have a lot of shadow magician issues

149
00:06:33,228 --> 00:06:36,509
because when I was younger I was told I

I realized what I<font color="#CCCCCC"> know dummy but that</font>

was it<font color="#E5E5E5"> was a shadow issue I carried the</font>

labeled that way through middle school

00:07:00,360 --> 00:07:05,069
but I wasn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> willing to look at it</font>

163
00:07:01,889 --> 00:07:08,250
<font color="#E5E5E5">because it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> was something that was thrown</font>

164
00:07:05,069 --> 00:07:09,870
at me and I said<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay fine</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> cast into the</font>

167
00:07:12,120 --> 00:07:15,449
they're the dummies you said that

168
00:07:13,560 --> 00:07:19,649
because they didn't realize<font color="#E5E5E5"> my fucking</font>

169
00:07:15,449 --> 00:07:21,839
brilliance anyway my point is that I had

170
00:07:19,649 --> 00:07:25,370
to look<font color="#E5E5E5"> at that I had to embrace that</font>

171
00:07:21,839 --> 00:07:27,839
act I had to really wrestle with that

172
00:07:25,370 --> 00:07:30,000
through my adulthood in order to come<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

173
00:07:27,839 --> 00:07:32,989
grips with the fact that that shouldn't

174
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:36,720
be something I carry around

175
00:07:32,990 --> 00:07:38,790
unconsciously I should shed light on it

176
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:43,320
meaning put it into perspective and

177
00:07:38,790 --> 00:07:46,040
healed the shadows Joseph Campbell has a

saying fuck a lot today<font color="#CCCCCC"> so um I get cast</font>

192
00:08:20,490 --> 00:08:25,860
into shadow but it could possibly be

193
00:08:22,259 --> 00:08:28,709
your greatest gift right talking a lot

194
00:08:25,860 --> 00:08:30,090
being energetic and outgoing could be

195

something that irritates your parents

and<font color="#E5E5E5"> teachers but might be something that</font>

causes your ascension to great heights

202
00:08:47,799 --> 00:08:53,139
<font color="#E5E5E5">one by being honest with ourselves</font>

really looking at<font color="#E5E5E5"> our strengths and</font>

00:08:53,139 --> 00:08:55,870
limitations and looking at our

limitations and asking<font color="#CCCCCC"> if they really</font>

206
00:08:55,870 --> 00:09:00,879
<font color="#E5E5E5">are limitations or gifts and looking at</font>

207
00:08:58,539 --> 00:09:03,129
our strengths<font color="#E5E5E5"> and wondering perhaps how</font>

208
00:09:00,879 --> 00:09:05,409
they might be stopping us from growing

209
00:09:03,129 --> 00:09:09,340
stronger oftentimes we personally

210
00:09:05,409 --> 00:09:10,659
identify or the ego becomes fixed on a

particular<font color="#E5E5E5"> strength and we think that</font>

00:09:10,659 --> 00:09:14,079
it's ours and we thinks it will never<font color="#E5E5E5"> go</font>

213
00:09:12,429 --> 00:09:16,569
<font color="#CCCCCC">away and we think that we should be</font>

praised for when in reality is just<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

passing thing like all things in life so

216
00:09:19,659 --> 00:09:24,730
your greatest strength could become a

217
00:09:21,730 --> 00:09:26,649
limitation and a shadow issue also the

218
00:09:24,730 --> 00:09:30,009
next thing would be in dealing with

219
00:09:26,649 --> 00:09:32,980
these types of issues is to ask for help

220
00:09:30,009 --> 00:09:35,860
<font color="#E5E5E5">when you realize you need it that means</font>

221
00:09:32,980 --> 00:09:38,350
from mentors that means from friends

222
00:09:35,860 --> 00:09:41,620
that means<font color="#E5E5E5"> from anyone who's got an</font>

00:09:38,350 --> 00:09:44,529
objective point of view about you so for

example<font color="#CCCCCC"> aya must have been about 10</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">years ago</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I took a took a course</font>

personal<font color="#E5E5E5"> development course in</font>

227
00:09:48,789 --> 00:09:56,490
California and up one of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> activities</font>

228
00:09:52,090 --> 00:10:01,480
we engaged in was confronting people

229
00:09:56,490 --> 00:10:03,389
with how we receive them right in other

230
00:10:01,480 --> 00:10:08,519
words you walk up to someone and say I

231
00:10:03,389 --> 00:10:14,949
receive you as arrogant and obnoxious

232
00:10:08,519 --> 00:10:18,779
right so for<font color="#E5E5E5"> example I was told by</font>

233
00:10:14,950 --> 00:10:22,030
another young woman who was objectively

234
00:10:18,779 --> 00:10:26,350
leering at me and she says I feel<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

235
00:10:22,029 --> 00:10:30,009
receive you as arrogant and I said well

236
00:10:26,350 --> 00:10:31,629
tell me<font color="#CCCCCC"> more and she was shocked because</font>

237
00:10:30,009 --> 00:10:34,240
arrogant people don't say tell me more

238
00:10:31,629 --> 00:10:35,950
but what it then where<font color="#CCCCCC"> is why she was</font>

239
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:37,810
shocked and<font color="#E5E5E5"> impressed was because no</font>

240
00:10:35,950 --> 00:10:40,030
one's ever done that<font color="#E5E5E5"> to her before I</font>

241
00:10:37,809 --> 00:10:41,289
call you arrogant or I said receiving it

242
00:10:40,029 --> 00:10:43,720
was arrogant you want to know more

243
00:10:41,289 --> 00:10:45,579
that's because I'm asking<font color="#E5E5E5"> for help if</font>

244
00:10:43,720 --> 00:10:47,680
I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> coming across as arrogant if you're</font>

receiving<font color="#E5E5E5"> me as arrogant now it might</font>

246
00:10:47,679 --> 00:10:52,269
<font color="#CCCCCC">not be totally mine it may be the way</font>

247
00:10:50,350 --> 00:10:53,769
you're receiving me and that's okay but

248
00:10:52,269 --> 00:10:55,328
I want<font color="#CCCCCC"> to know why I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> want to know how</font>

249
00:10:53,769 --> 00:10:58,958
can you point out some

00:10:55,328 --> 00:11:01,988
very<font color="#E5E5E5"> specific things activity behaviors</font>

251

up circumstances we were in that perhaps

252
00:11:01,989 --> 00:11:07,028
I wasn't<font color="#CCCCCC"> aware of right sometimes we're</font>

253
00:11:05,470 --> 00:11:08,290
at work most<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the times we're acting</font>

00:11:07,028 --> 00:11:10,119
unconsciously and if I did something

unconscious to you please i want to know

256
00:11:10,119 --> 00:11:15,970
that way<font color="#CCCCCC"> i can shed light on it with</font>

issues shadows as opposed to brick walls
