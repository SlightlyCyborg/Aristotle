1
00:00:00,350 --> 00:00:06,359
so in more than one occasion<font color="#E5E5E5"> I've heard</font>

2
00:00:03,299 --> 00:00:08,460
someone say or I've read comments that

3
00:00:06,359 --> 00:00:10,469
sound a bit like this that guy Elliott

4
00:00:08,460 --> 00:00:14,269
Hulse he's pretty interesting but

5
00:00:10,468 --> 00:00:18,509
<font color="#E5E5E5">everything he says is common sense</font>

6
00:00:14,269 --> 00:00:22,198
somehow seeking to dilute the<font color="#CCCCCC"> messages</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

7
00:00:18,510 --> 00:00:24,179
bring across in these videos so the very

8
00:00:22,199 --> 00:00:29,550
first thing you've got<font color="#CCCCCC"> to understand is</font>

9
00:00:24,179 --> 00:00:33,629
that none of this is common sense what

10
00:00:29,550 --> 00:00:34,649
you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> talking about is common think so</font>

11
00:00:33,630 --> 00:00:37,290
there's a difference between thinking

12
00:00:34,649 --> 00:00:39,210
something and sensing something to<font color="#E5E5E5"> think</font>

13
00:00:37,289 --> 00:00:43,259
something means that you know it in your

14
00:00:39,210 --> 00:00:45,808
<font color="#CCCCCC">head so</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> obese people know in their head</font>

15
00:00:43,259 --> 00:00:48,449
that exercise and eating right will make

16
00:00:45,808 --> 00:00:52,289
them<font color="#E5E5E5"> not fat but they don't sense it</font>

17
00:00:48,450 --> 00:00:56,699
because sensing is an action of the body

18
00:00:52,289 --> 00:01:00,030
sensing sanctioning happens in the body

19
00:00:56,698 --> 00:01:02,250
right we have senses that aren't

20
00:01:00,030 --> 00:01:04,530
necessarily<font color="#CCCCCC"> tied to the conscious brain</font>

21
00:01:02,250 --> 00:01:06,090
to the<font color="#E5E5E5"> thinking brain right or what we</font>

22
00:01:04,530 --> 00:01:07,710
<font color="#CCCCCC">would call the thinking brain they're</font>

23
00:01:06,090 --> 00:01:09,090
more tied to the vegetative nervous

24
00:01:07,709 --> 00:01:11,728
system that part of the brain<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

25
00:01:09,090 --> 00:01:14,670
thinks without you having to think<font color="#CCCCCC"> about</font>

26
00:01:11,728 --> 00:01:19,129
it and<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's where senses come from so</font>

27
00:01:14,670 --> 00:01:22,680
when I say things<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> seem pretty</font>

28
00:01:19,129 --> 00:01:24,478
common thinkable it's because those

29
00:01:22,680 --> 00:01:26,220
ideas are simply in people's<font color="#E5E5E5"> heads and</font>

30
00:01:24,478 --> 00:01:27,959
they could go around spilling them all

31
00:01:26,219 --> 00:01:31,109
day<font color="#CCCCCC"> long they've watched my videos</font>

32
00:01:27,959 --> 00:01:32,728
they've read books they live on earth a

33
00:01:31,109 --> 00:01:36,478
lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of these I none of these ideas</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> are</font>

34
00:01:32,728 --> 00:01:38,310
new but they're not common sense when

35
00:01:36,478 --> 00:01:40,319
you actually put them into practice and

36
00:01:38,310 --> 00:01:43,649
feel them in your body because of your

37
00:01:40,319 --> 00:01:46,469
experience then it becomes common sense

38
00:01:43,649 --> 00:01:48,829
until then it's just common<font color="#CCCCCC"> fucking</font>

39
00:01:46,469 --> 00:01:48,828
think
