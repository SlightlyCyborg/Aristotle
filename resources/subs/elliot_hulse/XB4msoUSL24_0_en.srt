1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,569
love this<font color="#E5E5E5"> question from our buddy Nick</font>

2
00:00:01,379 --> 00:00:05,639
here who's graduating high school this

3
00:00:03,569 --> 00:00:09,449
year and he wants<font color="#E5E5E5"> to go to a university</font>

4
00:00:05,639 --> 00:00:12,449
in another city the problem is his

5
00:00:09,449 --> 00:00:16,350
parents don't want him<font color="#E5E5E5"> to leave their</font>

6
00:00:12,449 --> 00:00:19,049
<font color="#E5E5E5">hometown I assume and will not support</font>

7
00:00:16,350 --> 00:00:21,750
<font color="#CCCCCC">him in going to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the University outside</font>

8
00:00:19,050 --> 00:00:24,300
of their<font color="#E5E5E5"> hometown and apparently his</font>

9
00:00:21,750 --> 00:00:28,859
parents are<font color="#E5E5E5"> a bit you know</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I use this</font>

10
00:00:24,300 --> 00:00:30,149
term it's my term overbearing they don't

11
00:00:28,859 --> 00:00:31,949
seem<font color="#CCCCCC"> to allow them to go out he's</font>

12
00:00:30,149 --> 00:00:33,530
constantly being grounded if his grades

13
00:00:31,949 --> 00:00:38,160
aren't right and he's got a pretty good

14
00:00:33,530 --> 00:00:40,950
GPA he feels as if he if he left<font color="#E5E5E5"> his</font>

15
00:00:38,159 --> 00:00:43,078
parents house and went to the University

16
00:00:40,950 --> 00:00:44,730
in a new city he would become a stronger

17
00:00:43,079 --> 00:00:47,670
version himself of himself you'd be

18
00:00:44,729 --> 00:00:49,769
growing up in absence of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the tyranny and</font>

19
00:00:47,670 --> 00:00:51,780
that's my word of it of his oppressive

20
00:00:49,770 --> 00:00:54,420
parents the problem is that<font color="#CCCCCC"> he needs</font>

21
00:00:51,780 --> 00:00:56,579
their support in order to go to apply to

22
00:00:54,420 --> 00:00:59,550
this school to pay for the school so on

23
00:00:56,579 --> 00:01:01,259
and so forth so now he's torn<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so</font>

24
00:00:59,549 --> 00:01:03,839
here's here's the way I'm gonna<font color="#E5E5E5"> ask you</font>

25
00:01:01,259 --> 00:01:06,329
<font color="#E5E5E5">to look at this my buddy my friend my</font>

26
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:08,850
young friend embarking upon the journey

27
00:01:06,329 --> 00:01:12,629
of<font color="#CCCCCC"> life feeling the call to action but</font>

28
00:01:08,849 --> 00:01:16,140
yet being in it in able to do it because

29
00:01:12,629 --> 00:01:19,219
<font color="#CCCCCC">of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you know those who control you at</font>

30
00:01:16,140 --> 00:01:21,390
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> point you're 17 years old I assume</font>

31
00:01:19,219 --> 00:01:22,500
it's not going to be the answer you want

32
00:01:21,390 --> 00:01:25,200
to hear and<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's probably not going to</font>

33
00:01:22,500 --> 00:01:29,790
<font color="#E5E5E5">be the most popular answer but here it</font>

34
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:32,460
is allow your parents to control you

35
00:01:29,790 --> 00:01:33,840
<font color="#CCCCCC">just a little bit longer you're 17 years</font>

36
00:01:32,459 --> 00:01:36,629
old<font color="#E5E5E5"> on doesn't</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> mean that you don't</font>

37
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:39,030
really<font color="#E5E5E5"> feel</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> this call to action and in</font>

38
00:01:36,629 --> 00:01:40,469
fact it may be a good opportunity for

39
00:01:39,030 --> 00:01:43,409
you to grow up and become a stronger

40
00:01:40,469 --> 00:01:44,399
version of yourself but<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're still at</font>

41
00:01:43,409 --> 00:01:45,689
an age where you're going to need your

42
00:01:44,399 --> 00:01:47,009
<font color="#CCCCCC">parents support especially if you're</font>

43
00:01:45,688 --> 00:01:48,328
<font color="#E5E5E5">going to go</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> through University or need</font>

44

their financial support you're going to

45
00:01:48,328 --> 00:01:53,039
need their moral support<font color="#E5E5E5"> and you don't</font>

46
00:01:50,430 --> 00:01:54,570
<font color="#E5E5E5">want to at this early on in</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> your adult</font>

47
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:58,110
life you don't want to break ties with

48
00:01:54,569 --> 00:02:01,019
your roots you know there may come a

49
00:01:58,109 --> 00:02:02,879
time ultimately where you've got to kill

50
00:02:01,019 --> 00:02:05,099
the master so to say you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> put your</font>

51
00:02:02,879 --> 00:02:07,109
parents aside and man up and beer be

52
00:02:05,099 --> 00:02:09,389
yourself I'm not feeling like that needs

53
00:02:07,109 --> 00:02:12,180
to happen just yet and here is some

54
00:02:09,389 --> 00:02:16,048
encouraging device advice if I

55
00:02:12,180 --> 00:02:19,890
it's a device also so it's a it's a idea

56
00:02:16,049 --> 00:02:22,049
device right very rarely do i edit these

57
00:02:19,889 --> 00:02:24,029
<font color="#E5E5E5">videos so if I say stupid things</font>

58
00:02:22,049 --> 00:02:25,438
sometimes just realize like<font color="#CCCCCC"> this guy</font>

59
00:02:24,030 --> 00:02:27,019
doesn't at his videos just<font color="#E5E5E5"> whatever</font>

60
00:02:25,438 --> 00:02:30,479
comes out is what needs to be said

61
00:02:27,019 --> 00:02:32,819
anyway what I would invite<font color="#CCCCCC"> you to</font>

62
00:02:30,479 --> 00:02:35,759
consider is that for years of university

63
00:02:32,818 --> 00:02:39,929
is a drop in the fucking bucket dude it

64
00:02:35,759 --> 00:02:41,578
<font color="#CCCCCC">is nothing it seems</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> like it's the whole</font>

65
00:02:39,930 --> 00:02:43,170
world is going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to crumble down on you if</font>

66
00:02:41,579 --> 00:02:46,230
you don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> take this leap onto into</font>

67
00:02:43,169 --> 00:02:49,078
adventure right now but taking four more

68
00:02:46,229 --> 00:02:52,048
years and allowing your character to

69
00:02:49,079 --> 00:02:53,790
incubate under the tutelage or the

70
00:02:52,049 --> 00:02:57,688
tyranny however you want to look of it

71
00:02:53,789 --> 00:03:00,388
look at<font color="#E5E5E5"> it of your</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> parents it's not the</font>

72
00:02:57,688 --> 00:03:03,209
end of the world in fact I think it

73
00:03:00,389 --> 00:03:05,010
might<font color="#CCCCCC"> be</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> okay I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> think it's better for</font>

74
00:03:03,209 --> 00:03:06,150
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> long-term relationship that you'll</font>

75
00:03:05,009 --> 00:03:08,718
<font color="#CCCCCC">have with</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> your parents I think your</font>

76
00:03:06,150 --> 00:03:12,419
parents<font color="#E5E5E5"> again this is all a lot again</font>

77
00:03:08,718 --> 00:03:16,079
when I make these videos they're not

78
00:03:12,419 --> 00:03:17,939
always based on<font color="#E5E5E5"> fat they're based on the</font>

79
00:03:16,079 --> 00:03:21,150
information that I get from you guys and

80
00:03:17,939 --> 00:03:22,289
the feeling I get while reading it the

81
00:03:21,150 --> 00:03:23,789
feeling<font color="#CCCCCC"> that I get is that your parents</font>

82
00:03:22,289 --> 00:03:26,608
are good people I don't think your

83
00:03:23,789 --> 00:03:29,840
<font color="#CCCCCC">parents are out to hurt you I think they</font>

84
00:03:26,609 --> 00:03:31,979
might be<font color="#CCCCCC"> a bit overbearing</font>

85
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:33,449
overprotective but it doesn't mean that

86
00:03:31,979 --> 00:03:35,970
<font color="#E5E5E5">they're they're the type of people that</font>

87
00:03:33,449 --> 00:03:38,040
want to see you hurt or to hurt you okay

88
00:03:35,969 --> 00:03:40,079
that's just<font color="#E5E5E5"> a feeling I get and I'm sure</font>

89
00:03:38,039 --> 00:03:45,060
you'd agree with me right if not let me

90
00:03:40,079 --> 00:03:46,889
<font color="#CCCCCC">know so you don't want to sever ties</font>

91
00:03:45,060 --> 00:03:48,628
with them you don't want to get on bad

92
00:03:46,889 --> 00:03:50,519
footing with them you don't want to ruin

93
00:03:48,628 --> 00:03:52,108
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> relationship with them there's</font>

94
00:03:50,519 --> 00:03:54,750
<font color="#E5E5E5">going to come a cop become a time when</font>

95
00:03:52,109 --> 00:03:56,639
you're forced to assert yourself now

96
00:03:54,750 --> 00:03:57,780
here's an interesting thing of course

97
00:03:56,639 --> 00:03:59,729
<font color="#E5E5E5">I'm beginning to right now with this</font>

98
00:03:57,780 --> 00:04:02,280
video and the<font color="#E5E5E5"> interesting thing</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is that</font>

99
00:03:59,729 --> 00:04:06,079
we're all called to action at some

100
00:04:02,280 --> 00:04:08,489
particular point in our lives some of us

101
00:04:06,079 --> 00:04:10,229
that call to action or the courage

102
00:04:08,489 --> 00:04:12,810
associated with taking action in our

103
00:04:10,229 --> 00:04:17,038
lives has been so suppressed to early

104
00:04:12,810 --> 00:04:19,680
childhood suppression that comes out in

105
00:04:17,038 --> 00:04:22,829
whimpers some of<font color="#E5E5E5"> us it comes out</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> very</font>

106
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:24,610
explosive in very rebellious about the

107
00:04:22,829 --> 00:04:28,688
time that about the age of 17

108
00:04:24,610 --> 00:04:31,689
23 what you don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> want to have happen if</font>

109
00:04:28,689 --> 00:04:34,389
you do decide to ignore the call to

110
00:04:31,689 --> 00:04:36,330
action for<font color="#CCCCCC"> the better for the bigger</font>

111
00:04:34,389 --> 00:04:39,490
picture for the betterment of everyone

112
00:04:36,329 --> 00:04:41,050
is to forget that call to action for

113
00:04:39,490 --> 00:04:42,788
years from now when<font color="#CCCCCC"> the opportunity</font>

114
00:04:41,050 --> 00:04:43,960
rises again and now you've got to go get

115
00:04:42,788 --> 00:04:46,509
a job you got to go<font color="#CCCCCC"> out into the real</font>

116
00:04:43,959 --> 00:04:49,089
world the real world is<font color="#E5E5E5"> another form of</font>

117
00:04:46,509 --> 00:04:51,098
and the real world including<font color="#CCCCCC"> whoever you</font>

118
00:04:49,089 --> 00:04:53,739
go work for if you decide<font color="#CCCCCC"> to work for</font>

119
00:04:51,098 --> 00:04:57,819
someone and the government is another

120
00:04:53,740 --> 00:04:59,860
form of parentage patriarchy right and

121
00:04:57,819 --> 00:05:02,770
then you then what ends up happening is

122
00:04:59,860 --> 00:05:05,889
we submit to that authority once again

123
00:05:02,769 --> 00:05:08,978
and never go out in our call to action

124
00:05:05,889 --> 00:05:12,759
we never build up the courage ever again

125
00:05:08,978 --> 00:05:13,870
to do something dangerous so that's it

126
00:05:12,759 --> 00:05:17,860
dude I don't wanna<font color="#E5E5E5"> make this that much</font>

127
00:05:13,870 --> 00:05:22,240
longer<font color="#E5E5E5"> than it needs to be I say take</font>

128
00:05:17,860 --> 00:05:23,949
your parents's advice do what you're

129
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:27,098
told right now not because you're a

130
00:05:23,949 --> 00:05:29,288
bitch or a bastard or or week or on

131
00:05:27,098 --> 00:05:31,180
couragous or you know anything that it's

132
00:05:29,288 --> 00:05:34,149
negative you do it for<font color="#E5E5E5"> the greater good</font>

133
00:05:31,180 --> 00:05:36,370
and realize<font color="#E5E5E5"> four years as a drop in the</font>

134
00:05:34,149 --> 00:05:38,769
bucket and in four years time you might

135
00:05:36,370 --> 00:05:41,348
<font color="#CCCCCC">even be stronger in your ability to</font>

136
00:05:38,769 --> 00:05:47,839
approach your call to action and make

137
00:05:41,348 --> 00:05:50,469
your stand as a man in the world

138
00:05:47,839 --> 00:05:50,469
done
