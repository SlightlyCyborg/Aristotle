there they decide to build their

10
00:00:29,699 --> 00:00:34,109
business and over the course of time

11
00:00:31,410 --> 00:00:36,480
they realize<font color="#CCCCCC"> that well maybe</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this wasn't</font>

12
00:00:34,109 --> 00:00:39,929

00:00:53,579 --> 00:00:58,590
Kenny's buddy leaves him his van now

21
00:00:56,189 --> 00:01:00,209
Kenny lives in<font color="#CCCCCC"> a van Kenny has no money</font>

22
00:00:58,590 --> 00:01:03,840
he has a<font color="#E5E5E5"> credit card that he's running</font>

24
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:10,740
<font color="#E5E5E5">he's stuck or he's making himself stuck</font>

25
00:01:07,379 --> 00:01:12,989
because essentially his family has wide

26
00:01:10,739 --> 00:01:15,658
open arms and awaiting for<font color="#CCCCCC"> Katie to come</font>

34
00:01:31,859 --> 00:01:43,129
that is honor is too big to do any<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

35
00:01:35,549 --> 00:01:46,850
that well you call it Honor I call it

36
00:01:43,129 --> 00:01:49,589
ego stubbornness and trying to be right

37
00:01:46,849 --> 00:01:51,569
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know because somewhere along the</font>

38
00:01:49,590 --> 00:01:53,310
line you believe that it's you you've

39
00:01:51,569 --> 00:01:55,258
<font color="#CCCCCC">been led to believe</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that you can't make</font>

40
00:01:53,310 --> 00:01:57,840
a mistake you've been led to believe

41
00:01:55,259 --> 00:01:59,968
<font color="#E5E5E5">that you can't fail you're not allowed</font>

42
00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:02,609
to fail because if you fail your honor

43
00:01:59,968 --> 00:02:04,739
will be at stake you've been led to

44
00:02:02,609 --> 00:02:07,259
believe that everything that you go<font color="#CCCCCC"> into</font>

45
00:02:04,739 --> 00:02:08,639
you have to achieve the ideal that you

46
00:02:07,259 --> 00:02:11,580
set out for yourself rather than allow

47
00:02:08,639 --> 00:02:13,378
it to be an experience Kenny you have

48
00:02:11,580 --> 00:02:15,360
<font color="#CCCCCC">experience was a great experience was a</font>

49
00:02:13,378 --> 00:02:17,699
great idea<font color="#CCCCCC"> I always say follow your</font>

50
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:20,190
bliss he follows<font color="#CCCCCC"> if he followed his</font>

51
00:02:17,699 --> 00:02:21,839
heart he thinks he's in the abyss right

52
00:02:20,189 --> 00:02:23,729
now he says essentially that you know

53
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:25,378
things it's gonna<font color="#E5E5E5"> work out it's gonna</font>

54
00:02:23,729 --> 00:02:27,750
<font color="#E5E5E5">work on us like that crazy-ass gambler</font>

55
00:02:25,378 --> 00:02:30,989
you know that guy who<font color="#E5E5E5"> lost it all he's</font>

56
00:02:27,750 --> 00:02:32,989

58
00:02:32,989 --> 00:02:38,128

59
00:02:34,979 --> 00:02:40,530
what I'm saying to you go home because

60
00:02:38,128 --> 00:02:43,439
being right doesn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> serve you the way</font>

61
00:02:40,530 --> 00:02:45,390
that you think it serves you being right

62
00:02:43,439 --> 00:02:48,689
in a situation like<font color="#E5E5E5"> this means that if</font>

63
00:02:45,389 --> 00:02:51,359
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> fail everyone will say oh but can he</font>

71
00:03:08,580 --> 00:03:12,599
present with every experience that you

72
00:03:11,039 --> 00:03:14,280
have so that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you get the most out of it</font>
