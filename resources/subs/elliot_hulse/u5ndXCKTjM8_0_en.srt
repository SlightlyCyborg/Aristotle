1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,109
so we got a question<font color="#CCCCCC"> here I got a</font>

2
00:00:01,350 --> 00:00:06,179
question<font color="#CCCCCC"> here from one</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of our viewers</font>

3
00:00:03,109 --> 00:00:08,539
about a<font color="#E5E5E5"> long-distance relationship our</font>

4
00:00:06,179 --> 00:00:10,830
friend apparently<font color="#CCCCCC"> has fallen in love</font>

5
00:00:08,539 --> 00:00:13,500
<font color="#CCCCCC">online and they've</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> been dating for a</font>

6
00:00:10,830 --> 00:00:17,009
year long distance through the internet

7
00:00:13,500 --> 00:00:18,660
it's an amazing time we live in four

8
00:00:17,010 --> 00:00:22,260
months ago<font color="#E5E5E5"> they actually met</font>

9
00:00:18,660 --> 00:00:26,070
face-to-face and were able to hug and

10
00:00:22,260 --> 00:00:29,400
cuddle and smooch and kiss and commence

11
00:00:26,070 --> 00:00:32,640
forth in physical love they finally<font color="#CCCCCC"> got</font>

12
00:00:29,399 --> 00:00:36,299
together and the fire of their passion

13
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:39,780
grew because of the intense experience

14
00:00:36,299 --> 00:00:41,578
of love not only emotional and mental

15
00:00:39,780 --> 00:00:45,590
through the internet but finally

16
00:00:41,579 --> 00:00:49,289
physical but our<font color="#E5E5E5"> friend has a problem he</font>

17
00:00:45,590 --> 00:00:51,899
had to go home and in parting ways with

18
00:00:49,289 --> 00:00:55,198
his love they promised<font color="#E5E5E5"> to stay together</font>

19
00:00:51,899 --> 00:00:58,920
no matter what<font color="#E5E5E5"> and she even promised to</font>

20
00:00:55,198 --> 00:01:02,939
leave her land thousands<font color="#E5E5E5"> of miles away</font>

21
00:00:58,920 --> 00:01:08,340
to come<font color="#E5E5E5"> and live with him she's going</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

22
00:01:02,939 --> 00:01:11,640
leave her family all her friends<font color="#CCCCCC"> and her</font>

23
00:01:08,340 --> 00:01:13,320
native language to come to a place where

24
00:01:11,640 --> 00:01:17,659
she has no family no friends and doesn't

25
00:01:13,319 --> 00:01:20,008
<font color="#E5E5E5">even speak</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the language right our friend</font>

26
00:01:17,659 --> 00:01:21,780
who asked this question is concerned

27
00:01:20,009 --> 00:01:23,700
because he wants to<font color="#E5E5E5"> know if</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> he has the</font>

28
00:01:21,780 --> 00:01:25,769
right to ask her<font color="#CCCCCC"> to leave all that she</font>

29
00:01:23,700 --> 00:01:29,400
knows all that she has to come<font color="#E5E5E5"> to a</font>

30
00:01:25,769 --> 00:01:32,269
foreign land<font color="#CCCCCC"> for love where she</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> doesn't</font>

00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:32,270
<font color="#E5E5E5">even speak the language</font>

32
00:01:32,819 --> 00:01:39,629
it's quite<font color="#CCCCCC"> the pickle as they would say</font>

33
00:01:37,129 --> 00:01:42,929
so here's<font color="#E5E5E5"> the thing</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> man I'm really</font>

34
00:01:39,629 --> 00:01:44,849

00:01:47,189 --> 00:01:51,950
<font color="#CCCCCC">land in love and passion in ecstasy</font>

38
00:01:52,189 --> 00:01:57,569
where she can't<font color="#CCCCCC"> even speak the language</font>

39
00:01:55,040 --> 00:02:01,200
but she's doing it because her heart is

40
00:01:57,569 --> 00:02:03,329
open to you it will<font color="#CCCCCC"> be</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the best intense</font>

46
00:02:20,639 --> 00:02:27,119
leave her friends come to a place where

47
00:02:24,030 --> 00:02:29,519
she's a stranger can't speak the

48
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:32,489
language it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not so sure she's only</font>

49
00:02:29,519 --> 00:02:35,459
seen you once to live with you in

50
00:02:32,489 --> 00:02:37,860
<font color="#E5E5E5">so-called love and passion and ecstasy</font>

51
00:02:35,459 --> 00:02:41,519
it could<font color="#CCCCCC"> possibly turn out to be the</font>

52
00:02:37,860 --> 00:02:43,049
<font color="#CCCCCC">worst thing</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that she's ever done and the</font>

00:02:41,519 --> 00:02:45,000
worst thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> that you've ever done</font>

56
00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:53,129
damn language my point is that either

57
00:02:50,579 --> 00:02:57,209
choice is going to be an intense

58
00:02:53,129 --> 00:02:59,129
experience and that my friend is why I'm

59
00:02:57,209 --> 00:03:01,090
so excited for<font color="#E5E5E5"> you damn phone keeps</font>

60
00:02:59,129 --> 00:03:04,400

life is<font color="#E5E5E5"> about intense experiences life</font>

62
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:10,819
is<font color="#E5E5E5"> about experiencing all the emotion</font>

63
00:03:08,210 --> 00:03:15,430
associated with joy ecstasy passion love

64
00:03:10,819 --> 00:03:18,949
and frustration anger sadness right

65
00:03:15,430 --> 00:03:22,550
that's what life is what happens is we

66
00:03:18,949 --> 00:03:26,750
like to<font color="#E5E5E5"> find this easy mediocre gray</font>

67
00:03:22,550 --> 00:03:30,080
lukewarm path to tread wear we never

68
00:03:26,750 --> 00:03:33,229
experienced any failure any frustration

69
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:35,540
any anger we never experienced any love

70
00:03:33,229 --> 00:03:37,579
I mean when I'm talking<font color="#CCCCCC"> about love and</font>

that's what love is that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> what life is</font>

74
00:03:42,229 --> 00:03:48,679
about on this unstable planet on this

75
00:03:46,969 --> 00:03:53,979
rock that's flying around in the sky

76
00:03:48,680 --> 00:03:57,830
somewhere that's what it's about so

77
00:03:53,979 --> 00:03:59,929
either choice is going to be an

78
00:03:57,830 --> 00:04:01,820
incredible experience is going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to add to</font>

97
00:04:35,930 --> 00:04:40,819
<font color="#CCCCCC">that but it will lack the intense</font>

98
00:04:37,550 --> 00:04:43,759
experience or the trust in the intense

99
00:04:40,819 --> 00:04:46,849
experience that you should enjoy<font color="#E5E5E5"> as a</font>

106
00:04:57,829 --> 00:05:02,060
something that's based on no evidence

107
00:04:59,199 --> 00:05:04,550
whatsoever but<font color="#E5E5E5"> sounds poetic and</font>

108
00:05:02,060 --> 00:05:06,829
beautiful you could lean on that also

109
00:05:04,550 --> 00:05:09,949
it's all based on someone else's

110
00:05:06,829 --> 00:05:11,560
experience someone<font color="#E5E5E5"> else's poetry someone</font>

111
00:05:09,949 --> 00:05:14,949
else's ideas so you

112
00:05:11,560 --> 00:05:17,290
live from someone else's back someone

113
00:05:14,949 --> 00:05:19,180
else's believe but you<font color="#E5E5E5"> got to live for</font>

00:05:17,290 --> 00:05:23,800
you so my friend I hope you make the

115
00:05:19,180 --> 00:05:28,319
right decision<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay I hope you do what</font>

116
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:32,168
you think<font color="#CCCCCC"> is right because</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> if you fail</font>

117
00:05:28,319 --> 00:05:33,730
successful<font color="#CCCCCC"> people make their failures</font>

118
00:05:32,168 --> 00:05:35,439
right they say that successful people

119
00:05:33,730 --> 00:05:37,000
don't always make the right decisions

120
00:05:35,439 --> 00:05:39,069
but they make their decisions right so

121
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:41,500
either way it's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be right and</font>

122
00:05:39,069 --> 00:05:43,060
it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to add to your experience to</font>

123
00:05:41,500 --> 00:05:46,269
your<font color="#E5E5E5"> character and make you a stronger</font>

124
00:05:43,060 --> 00:05:50,668
version of yourself so go fail as fast

125
00:05:46,269 --> 00:05:50,668
as you fucking can hope that helps
