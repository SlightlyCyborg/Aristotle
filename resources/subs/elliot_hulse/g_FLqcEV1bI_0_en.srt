7
00:00:29,679 --> 00:00:33,549
the way that he's evolving he's getting

8
00:00:31,600 --> 00:00:35,439
involved in his health and his personal

9
00:00:33,549 --> 00:00:38,140
growth he's becoming a stronger version

10
00:00:35,439 --> 00:00:40,719
of himself but they're still smoking and

11

16
00:00:51,369 --> 00:00:55,659
he's not spending time with them they're

17
00:00:53,679 --> 00:00:57,609
starting to feel resentful towards him

18
00:00:55,659 --> 00:00:59,469
because you know now he's better than

19
00:00:57,609 --> 00:01:01,179
them because he's exercising and eating

20
00:00:59,469 --> 00:01:03,579
well<font color="#E5E5E5"> and growing stronger and they're</font>

30
00:01:25,599 --> 00:01:32,019

36
00:01:42,040 --> 00:01:46,930
coldness begins and family separate and

37
00:01:45,010 --> 00:01:49,868
then you know the typical path then

38
00:01:46,930 --> 00:01:51,280
becomes you you move across the<font color="#CCCCCC"> country</font>

39
00:01:49,868 --> 00:01:54,340
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> you don't see each other for years</font>

40
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:56,739
<font color="#E5E5E5">and resentment grows between the two</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>
