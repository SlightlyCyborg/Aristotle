1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,629
what all things like you're saying like

2
00:00:02,129 --> 00:00:05,429
we manifest very weak screen in our

3
00:00:03,629 --> 00:00:07,250
heads right we came together<font color="#E5E5E5"> as a</font>

4
00:00:05,429 --> 00:00:09,660
community or whatever and we created

5
00:00:07,250 --> 00:00:11,429
economy like what is economy right it's

6
00:00:09,660 --> 00:00:12,839
it's not a thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> that you know girls</font>

7
00:00:11,429 --> 00:00:17,070
under the ground is full of the might

8
00:00:12,839 --> 00:00:23,129
yeah yeah yeah it's just the illusion

9
00:00:17,070 --> 00:00:25,079
yeah it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> a game but</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we become I</font>

10
00:00:23,129 --> 00:00:26,969
personally identified with it and that's

11
00:00:25,079 --> 00:00:29,009
when it sickens us I think it's cool to

12
00:00:26,969 --> 00:00:31,948
play economy it's cool<font color="#E5E5E5"> to play</font>

13
00:00:29,010 --> 00:00:35,010
civilization as long as we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> a person</font>

14
00:00:31,949 --> 00:00:37,800
identified with it and which is

15
00:00:35,009 --> 00:00:39,539
difficult from one for a difficult one

16
00:00:37,799 --> 00:00:41,189
for us now of course being personally

17
00:00:39,539 --> 00:00:44,308
identified with it which is is the

18
00:00:41,189 --> 00:00:48,539
individual sickness but the collective

19
00:00:44,308 --> 00:00:50,968
sickness is a manifestation of defying

20
00:00:48,539 --> 00:00:54,120
the second important rule which is cause

21
00:00:50,969 --> 00:00:57,090
no harm and we cause harm to each other

22
00:00:54,119 --> 00:00:59,698
recourse harm to the planet and that's

23
00:00:57,090 --> 00:01:02,820
our that's our demise play economy play

24
00:00:59,698 --> 00:01:04,649
society play nations play languages play

25
00:01:02,820 --> 00:01:06,060
religions play all these things because

26
00:01:04,650 --> 00:01:07,830
they're beautiful they're their

27
00:01:06,060 --> 00:01:10,920
manifestations of a brilliant

28
00:01:07,829 --> 00:01:14,400
consciousness but don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> be personally</font>

29
00:01:10,920 --> 00:01:15,978
identified and cause no harm and would

30
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:17,909
be much happier

31
00:01:15,978 --> 00:01:21,328

43
00:01:53,429 --> 00:01:59,759
going to sound ignorant but only because

44
00:01:56,188 --> 00:02:02,368
<font color="#E5E5E5">of my</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> perspective but being able to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> have</font>

45
00:01:59,759 --> 00:02:05,759

00:02:21,060 --> 00:02:23,699
anybody else that was<font color="#E5E5E5"> that April would</font>

54
00:02:22,949 --> 00:02:26,429
have been<font color="#E5E5E5"> able to have a conversation</font>

55
00:02:23,699 --> 00:02:28,199
like<font color="#E5E5E5"> this when I was growing up in my</font>

00:02:26,430 --> 00:02:29,400
high school in Long<font color="#CCCCCC"> Island it's not</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

57
00:02:28,199 --> 00:02:34,138
say that the people<font color="#E5E5E5"> there were stupid</font>

58
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:37,530
but we didn't have the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Internet exactly</font>

59
00:02:34,139 --> 00:02:39,030
and the internet I mean I don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> know if</font>

60
00:02:37,530 --> 00:02:40,829
maybe this is just innate knowledge or

61
00:02:39,030 --> 00:02:42,120
your parents are really smart people<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

64
00:02:43,769 --> 00:02:51,379
Internet has created an explosion of

65
00:02:46,699 --> 00:02:55,318
consciousness that allows young bright

66
00:02:51,379 --> 00:02:59,969
absorbent minds<font color="#E5E5E5"> to dig into ideas that</font>

67
00:02:55,318 --> 00:03:03,409
adults just<font color="#E5E5E5"> a generation before I've</font>

Middle America somewhere goes and has a

99
00:04:10,199 --> 00:04:14,790
conversation obviously they have to

100
00:04:11,789 --> 00:04:16,348
speak the same language with a man of

101
00:04:14,789 --> 00:04:18,478
the same age with let's say they both

102
00:04:16,348 --> 00:04:20,189
have three children and they're both

103
00:04:18,478 --> 00:04:23,819
socioeconomically about the same in

104
00:04:20,189 --> 00:04:26,639
their current cultures from Afghanistan

105
