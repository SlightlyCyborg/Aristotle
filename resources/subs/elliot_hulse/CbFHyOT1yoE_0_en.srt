1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,569
got a question for my<font color="#E5E5E5"> buddy</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Aidan who</font>

2
00:00:02,129 --> 00:00:05,878
has been dating a girl for about a year

3
00:00:03,569 --> 00:00:07,648
and and they recently broke up here's

4
00:00:05,878 --> 00:00:09,058
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> thing though he thought you would</font>

5
00:00:07,649 --> 00:00:12,570
come<font color="#E5E5E5"> to her house when they were dating</font>

6
00:00:09,058 --> 00:00:15,088
and hang out<font color="#CCCCCC"> with her family so much so</font>

7
00:00:12,570 --> 00:00:18,089
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> the family is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> basically integrated</font>

8
00:00:15,089 --> 00:00:19,679
him into their familiar construct they

9
00:00:18,089 --> 00:00:22,710
would<font color="#CCCCCC"> even take him on vacation and shit</font>

10
00:00:19,679 --> 00:00:25,469
like that so he has a<font color="#E5E5E5"> great relationship</font>

11
00:00:22,710 --> 00:00:28,980
with<font color="#E5E5E5"> her siblings her mother and in</font>

12
00:00:25,469 --> 00:00:31,799
particular this girl's father who he

13
00:00:28,980 --> 00:00:34,558
sees as a second dad right but now he

14
00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:37,530
broke up with her so a year of adopting

15
00:00:34,558 --> 00:00:39,238
a new family or family adopting you and

16
00:00:37,530 --> 00:00:42,058
then you guys are breaking up and the

17
00:00:39,238 --> 00:00:43,799
<font color="#E5E5E5">problem is he go he still goes her their</font>

18
00:00:42,058 --> 00:00:46,049
house<font color="#CCCCCC"> to hang out with the dad and hang</font>

19
00:00:43,799 --> 00:00:47,788
out the siblings and stuff and he sees

20
00:00:46,049 --> 00:00:49,558
her coming and you know they'll glance

21
00:00:47,789 --> 00:00:51,660
and like smile at each other but she'll

22
00:00:49,558 --> 00:00:54,359
go about her business and he'll die kind

23
00:00:51,659 --> 00:00:56,218
of be there he still loves her still has

24
00:00:54,359 --> 00:00:57,960
<font color="#CCCCCC">more feeling towards her but comes to</font>

25
00:00:56,219 --> 00:01:00,359
the house because<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> family invites it</font>

26
00:00:57,960 --> 00:01:02,189
invites<font color="#E5E5E5"> him over and and wants to hang</font>

27
00:01:00,359 --> 00:01:05,849
<font color="#E5E5E5">out with him n he really enjoys their</font>

28
00:01:02,189 --> 00:01:08,219
presence so the<font color="#E5E5E5"> question is should he</font>

29
00:01:05,849 --> 00:01:09,839
just like cut out completely because of

30
00:01:08,219 --> 00:01:11,908
the pain associated with seeing her

31
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:14,520
every<font color="#E5E5E5"> time he goes there knowing</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

32
00:01:11,909 --> 00:01:16,049
he's also losing a second family and

33
00:01:14,519 --> 00:01:18,298
knowing<font color="#E5E5E5"> that these</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> people actually</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> care</font>

34
00:01:16,049 --> 00:01:21,299
for<font color="#CCCCCC"> him as well right the reason why I</font>

35
00:01:18,299 --> 00:01:25,080
took your question is because I have had

36
00:01:21,299 --> 00:01:27,509
the same exact experience except I was

37
00:01:25,079 --> 00:01:30,599
on the other end of the spectrum my

38
00:01:27,509 --> 00:01:32,188
<font color="#CCCCCC">now-wife right so</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I'll get to what I</font>

39
00:01:30,599 --> 00:01:34,709
<font color="#CCCCCC">think</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is going to happen if you haven't</font>

40
00:01:32,188 --> 00:01:37,349
figured it out already when we were

41
00:01:34,709 --> 00:01:39,688
dating in high school in ecology we were

42
00:01:37,349 --> 00:01:42,390
very young were 14<font color="#E5E5E5"> and my family</font>

43
00:01:39,688 --> 00:01:43,739
basically adopted her as one of our own

44
00:01:42,390 --> 00:01:46,409
you know I've<font color="#CCCCCC"> got three brothers and</font>

45
00:01:43,739 --> 00:01:48,839
sisters and my parents<font color="#E5E5E5"> like she was at</font>

46
00:01:46,409 --> 00:01:50,310
our house like every<font color="#E5E5E5"> single day and she</font>

47
00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:52,049
really became a part of the family<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

48
00:01:50,310 --> 00:01:53,340
there were times<font color="#E5E5E5"> when I was just like I</font>

49
00:01:52,049 --> 00:01:55,290
was fucked I was done with her I was

50
00:01:53,340 --> 00:01:56,549
like I fustrated I was just like I broke

51
00:01:55,290 --> 00:01:59,430
up with it I wrote with so many damn

52
00:01:56,549 --> 00:02:01,500
<font color="#E5E5E5">times was ridiculous but she still kept</font>

53
00:01:59,430 --> 00:02:02,969
coming over she came over<font color="#E5E5E5"> cuz my sister</font>

54
00:02:01,500 --> 00:02:05,700
<font color="#E5E5E5">wanted to hang out with her they go them</font>

55
00:02:02,968 --> 00:02:07,109
all together or her and<font color="#E5E5E5"> my brothers</font>

56
00:02:05,700 --> 00:02:09,719
would do something together<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know and</font>

57
00:02:07,109 --> 00:02:10,868
watch movies and you know she'd go my

58
00:02:09,719 --> 00:02:12,489
mom would like take her

59
00:02:10,868 --> 00:02:14,949
the salon<font color="#E5E5E5"> to get her hair cut and shit</font>

60
00:02:12,489 --> 00:02:16,628
and like I be home I'd be like why she

61
00:02:14,949 --> 00:02:20,079
here and she would<font color="#CCCCCC"> just like she's</font>

62
00:02:16,628 --> 00:02:22,419
smiling and wave and I don't know if

63
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:24,340
it's good or bad I don't know you know I

64
00:02:22,419 --> 00:02:26,109
can't<font color="#CCCCCC"> place judgment on it but the</font>

65
00:02:24,340 --> 00:02:27,640
reason why I tell you<font color="#E5E5E5"> this story the</font>

66
00:02:26,110 --> 00:02:30,129
reason why I took your questions because

67
00:02:27,639 --> 00:02:32,139
in my experience you guys are just<font color="#E5E5E5"> gonna</font>

68
00:02:30,128 --> 00:02:34,359
get<font color="#E5E5E5"> back together I know you have pain</font>

69
00:02:32,139 --> 00:02:36,429
when you see<font color="#CCCCCC"> her if you say that she</font>

70
00:02:34,360 --> 00:02:38,049
giggles and smiles and his flirtatious

71
00:02:36,430 --> 00:02:40,239
with you when you when you walk by<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

72
00:02:38,049 --> 00:02:43,060
shit I think the<font color="#E5E5E5"> break-up is going is</font>

73
00:02:40,239 --> 00:02:45,039
temporary right and I only say that

74
00:02:43,060 --> 00:02:46,840
because of my experience I don't have

75
00:02:45,039 --> 00:02:49,060
any like practical advice for you here

76
00:02:46,840 --> 00:02:51,759
or paradigms I'm just<font color="#E5E5E5"> giving you hope</font>

77
00:02:49,060 --> 00:02:53,650
because because I was in a very similar

78
00:02:51,759 --> 00:02:57,780
situation and this is the way it turned

79
00:02:53,650 --> 00:03:01,239
<font color="#E5E5E5">out my family adopted Colleen and I</font>

80
00:02:57,780 --> 00:03:03,759
married her several years later and I

81
00:03:01,239 --> 00:03:05,769
mean you know I'm very<font color="#CCCCCC"> happily married</font>

82
00:03:03,759 --> 00:03:07,209
with a more so than I think then like

83
00:03:05,769 --> 00:03:09,879
ninety-nine percent of the people who

84
00:03:07,209 --> 00:03:12,299
say they're happily married you know so

85
00:03:09,878 --> 00:03:17,098
dude I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think it's going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to be a long</font>

86
00:03:12,299 --> 00:03:19,209
beautiful healthy vibrant vital

87
00:03:17,098 --> 00:03:21,699
passionate relationship between the two

88
00:03:19,209 --> 00:03:24,489
<font color="#CCCCCC">of you is just yeah you're</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> going through</font>

89
00:03:21,699 --> 00:03:26,918
a moment of separation it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> normal</font>

90
00:03:24,489 --> 00:03:28,628
you're young too we you know that's what

91
00:03:26,919 --> 00:03:29,829
happened with<font color="#E5E5E5"> me so I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> think</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that's</font>
