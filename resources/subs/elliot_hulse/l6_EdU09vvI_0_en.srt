00:00:20,489 --> 00:00:25,709
lately and they started to show a great

7
00:00:22,679 --> 00:00:29,370
interest in functional training after

8
00:00:25,710 --> 00:00:31,019
they've seen my results when she was

to master these exercises without having

them get injured thanks Austin<font color="#E5E5E5"> well</font>

15
00:00:44,628 --> 00:00:50,640
Austin as you know I'm a coach and I've

16
00:00:47,999 --> 00:00:52,199
gotten great results with my clients but

17
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:55,079
what you might not know is<font color="#CCCCCC"> that I've</font>

18
00:00:52,198 --> 00:00:57,358
<font color="#E5E5E5">been coached and and throughout my</font>

00:00:55,079 --> 00:01:02,069
career as a football player strong man

20
00:00:57,359 --> 00:01:04,978
and in my internships mentor ships in

21
00:01:02,069 --> 00:01:06,719
becoming a coach I've had some really

22
00:01:04,978 --> 00:01:08,310
<font color="#E5E5E5">incredible coaches and I can think of</font>

23
00:01:06,718 --> 00:01:10,978
two in particular and the interesting

24
00:01:08,310 --> 00:01:14,939
<font color="#CCCCCC">thing between about these two coaches is</font>

25
00:01:10,978 --> 00:01:16,679
that they said very little it wasn't<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

26
00:01:14,938 --> 00:01:18,898
matter of what they said or cues they

27
00:01:16,680 --> 00:01:23,460
used it was a matter of who they were

28
00:01:18,899 --> 00:01:25,079
being and what they expected of me when

29
00:01:23,459 --> 00:01:27,899
I trained with them i'll tell you what i

30
00:01:25,078 --> 00:01:30,959
<font color="#CCCCCC">mean so right out of college I started</font>

working<font color="#E5E5E5"> for a guy in Long</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Island and use</font>

32
00:01:30,959 --> 00:01:36,569
a very<font color="#E5E5E5"> conservative I learned a lot of</font>

33
00:01:34,590 --> 00:01:38,009
my training techniques with regard to

34
00:01:36,569 --> 00:01:41,489
the deadlift than the front<font color="#E5E5E5"> squat all</font>

35
00:01:38,009 --> 00:01:46,319
this you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know very very uh row how would</font>

you<font color="#E5E5E5"> say I'm conservative form through</font>

37
00:01:46,319 --> 00:01:51,928
this coach and<font color="#CCCCCC"> the way he taught me</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> was</font>

38
00:01:49,890 --> 00:01:53,280
by having me train with him said the

39
00:01:51,929 --> 00:01:56,009
<font color="#E5E5E5">best way you're gonna learn this is by</font>

40
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:57,868
you doing it with me so I he do it of

41
00:01:56,009 --> 00:02:00,450
course like with any training partner he

42
00:01:57,868 --> 00:02:03,060
do a set and I'd watch him I just

43
00:02:00,450 --> 00:02:05,520
watching<font color="#E5E5E5"> and then he'd say okay now I</font>

44
00:02:03,060 --> 00:02:07,228
want<font color="#CCCCCC"> you to try the same thing and then</font>

45
00:02:05,519 --> 00:02:10,019
I do the<font color="#E5E5E5"> set he wouldn't say very much</font>

46
00:02:07,228 --> 00:02:10,770
<font color="#E5E5E5">he might say good or pick your chest up</font>

47
00:02:10,019 --> 00:02:12,930
a little bit or

48
00:02:10,770 --> 00:02:15,780
very few things didn't say very much at

49
00:02:12,930 --> 00:02:17,640
all and then I put<font color="#E5E5E5"> the weight down and</font>

50
00:02:15,780 --> 00:02:21,990
then he'd do it again and I'd watch him

51
00:02:17,639 --> 00:02:24,449
and then<font color="#E5E5E5"> over time just because I'd see</font>

52
00:02:21,990 --> 00:02:27,420
him do it and then I practice it right

53
00:02:24,449 --> 00:02:29,399
after him I began to pick up on all<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

54
00:02:27,419 --> 00:02:32,069
the little my new show all the little

55
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:34,230
train in strange intricacies of the way

56
00:02:32,069 --> 00:02:36,000
he did the movement it was because<font color="#E5E5E5"> I was</font>

57
00:02:34,229 --> 00:02:38,519
<font color="#E5E5E5">doing the thing with him all the time</font>

58
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:40,969
that I was able to<font color="#E5E5E5"> grow my ability</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

59
00:02:38,520 --> 00:02:44,790
perform the movement right interesting

60
00:02:40,969 --> 00:02:49,289
monkey see monkey do there wasn't much

61
00:02:44,789 --> 00:02:51,150
<font color="#E5E5E5">monkey talking so quite frankly there</font>

62
00:02:49,289 --> 00:02:52,949
wasn't much<font color="#E5E5E5"> cueing or talking going on</font>

63
00:02:51,150 --> 00:02:55,439
it was<font color="#E5E5E5"> a matter of me doing what I saw</font>

64
00:02:52,949 --> 00:02:57,119
him doing and constantly trying to<font color="#E5E5E5"> use</font>

65
00:02:55,439 --> 00:02:59,219
my own kinesthetic awareness which

66
00:02:57,120 --> 00:03:00,659
everyone has you know the more they

67
00:02:59,219 --> 00:03:04,620
train with you the more they'll be like

68
00:03:00,659 --> 00:03:06,659
you and<font color="#CCCCCC"> you know</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Larry there there goes</font>

69
00:03:04,620 --> 00:03:07,530
that was the coaching technique<font color="#CCCCCC"> all</font>

70
00:03:06,659 --> 00:03:09,150
<font color="#CCCCCC">right so if you're training with your</font>

71
00:03:07,530 --> 00:03:11,909
training partners and they see you doing

72
00:03:09,150 --> 00:03:13,289
it and then they<font color="#CCCCCC"> go and do it and if</font>

73
00:03:11,909 --> 00:03:14,639
that you know the other<font color="#E5E5E5"> thing is with</font>

74
00:03:13,289 --> 00:03:16,109
you got too many training partners it

75
00:03:14,639 --> 00:03:17,669
becomes a you know shit show where you

76
00:03:16,110 --> 00:03:18,720
guys<font color="#CCCCCC"> are all exercising your jaw you</font>

77
00:03:17,669 --> 00:03:20,458
know talking<font color="#E5E5E5"> about a whole bunch of</font>

78
00:03:18,719 --> 00:03:21,810
bullshit or check it out your<font color="#E5E5E5"> iPhone's</font>

79
00:03:20,459 --> 00:03:24,509
and stuff but if they're actually

80
00:03:21,810 --> 00:03:26,280
observing you and you're observing them

81
00:03:24,509 --> 00:03:29,129
and you're<font color="#CCCCCC"> working together it's just a</font>

82
00:03:26,280 --> 00:03:32,849
<font color="#E5E5E5">matter of osmosis being in your presence</font>

83
00:03:29,129 --> 00:03:34,199
they will gain strength and and you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know</font>

84
00:03:32,849 --> 00:03:35,579
you're choosing the exercises and

85
00:03:34,199 --> 00:03:36,869
they're in the routine and of<font color="#CCCCCC"> course</font>

86
00:03:35,580 --> 00:03:39,420
you're choosing exercises that help

87
00:03:36,870 --> 00:03:41,219
support the development of those lips

88
00:03:39,419 --> 00:03:42,179
like accessory lifts they keep doing

89
00:03:41,219 --> 00:03:45,270
<font color="#E5E5E5">what you're doing they're going to get</font>

90
00:03:42,180 --> 00:03:49,560
what you get right the other coach was

91
00:03:45,270 --> 00:03:50,820
my strong man coach Tom Mitchell and you

92
00:03:49,560 --> 00:03:52,379
know of<font color="#CCCCCC"> course straw man is on the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> other</font>

93
00:03:50,819 --> 00:03:53,789
<font color="#E5E5E5">end of the spectrum that's why you know</font>

94
00:03:52,379 --> 00:03:55,379
it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of interesting the way I coach</font>

95
00:03:53,789 --> 00:03:57,299
is because I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> very conservative I</font>

96
00:03:55,379 --> 00:04:00,060
learned from my conservative coach and

97
00:03:57,300 --> 00:04:02,910
then I also<font color="#E5E5E5"> went did straw man i get</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> my</font>

98
00:04:00,060 --> 00:04:05,520
hand straight and and he<font color="#E5E5E5"> was very</font>

99
00:04:02,909 --> 00:04:06,659
<font color="#E5E5E5">liberal meaning like I don't give a fuck</font>

100
00:04:05,520 --> 00:04:09,060
<font color="#CCCCCC">what you do as long as you hurt yourself</font>

101
00:04:06,659 --> 00:04:11,729
cuz<font color="#E5E5E5"> I ain't cleaning up the mess that</font>

102
00:04:09,060 --> 00:04:14,159
was his attitude and you know we're

103
00:04:11,729 --> 00:04:16,199
lifting stones and flipping tires and

104
00:04:14,159 --> 00:04:18,810
carrying kegs and putting a little

105
00:04:16,199 --> 00:04:21,079
these big yolks you've seen these in

106
00:04:18,810 --> 00:04:25,050
some<font color="#E5E5E5"> of my videos and it was completely</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">just point and say go ahead and pick</font>

00:04:36,540 --> 00:04:40,650
rested his arms on it right so he's
