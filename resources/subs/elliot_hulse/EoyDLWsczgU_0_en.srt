2
00:00:02,279 --> 00:00:06,689
combination of a lot of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the answers that</font>

00:00:03,810 --> 00:00:09,259
you have already given but mainly for me

4
00:00:06,690 --> 00:00:14,490
I'm at a point in my life this is my son

7
00:00:16,949 --> 00:00:22,170
myself I give<font color="#E5E5E5"> everything to everybody</font>

8
00:00:19,289 --> 00:00:25,560

00:00:25,559 --> 00:00:29,640
things for myself or I tour I can't find

11
00:00:27,750 --> 00:00:32,579

doing so why don't we keep<font color="#CCCCCC"> get</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> from you</font>

13
00:00:32,579 --> 00:00:37,710
some sense of what<font color="#CCCCCC"> what advice would you</font>

14
00:00:35,070 --> 00:00:40,409
give to someone who almost feels like

15
00:00:37,710 --> 00:00:42,090
him<font color="#E5E5E5"> I have given up I have everything</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> in</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">the world that I need help everything</font>

17
00:00:42,090 --> 00:00:50,370
but um physically I don't feel well but

18
00:00:46,590 --> 00:00:53,750
<font color="#CCCCCC">it just almost don't care and I don't</font>

19
00:00:50,369 --> 00:00:57,349
like that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I just don't know how to get</font>

24
00:01:13,129 --> 00:01:23,868
everything that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you have for them and</font>

25
00:01:19,989 --> 00:01:27,769
that's a role that you become personally

26
00:01:23,868 --> 00:01:29,829
identified right how old is your

27
00:01:27,769 --> 00:01:29,829
youngest

28
00:01:33,980 --> 00:01:41,400
you bend like that bow and essentially

29
00:01:39,290 --> 00:01:43,290
you're moving into<font color="#E5E5E5"> a different stage</font>

30
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:44,340
you've got teenagers and older you're

31
00:01:43,290 --> 00:01:52,020
not making peanut butter and jelly

32
00:01:44,340 --> 00:01:55,439

their own characters<font color="#CCCCCC"> i disagree with</font>

36
00:02:03,060 --> 00:02:09,840
that to a point my husband<font color="#E5E5E5"> has</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> been very</font>

37
00:02:05,849 --> 00:02:12,959
very loving but almost sheltering them

38
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:14,430
where if you know if<font color="#CCCCCC"> i cook a meal and</font>

00:02:12,959 --> 00:02:16,650
they<font color="#CCCCCC"> don't want it they can have</font>

40
00:02:14,430 --> 00:02:18,450
<font color="#CCCCCC">whatever else they want so they've</font>

44
00:02:24,330 --> 00:02:29,340

56
00:02:53,209 --> 00:02:58,370
to taking on different roles either

this is this general might not be

62
00:03:12,259 --> 00:03:16,370
specific to your situation but this

63
00:03:13,729 --> 00:03:18,049
might be useful<font color="#E5E5E5"> often times to get a</font>

64
00:03:16,370 --> 00:03:20,480
<font color="#E5E5E5">different response from the people of</font>

00:03:42,139 --> 00:03:46,879
invitation to<font color="#CCCCCC"> you and this is easier</font>

76
00:03:45,139 --> 00:03:49,429
said than<font color="#CCCCCC"> done but</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I know this is what</font>

77
00:03:46,879 --> 00:03:52,039
you want and this will change the way

78
00:03:49,430 --> 00:03:55,939
they behave towards you is to lose

79
00:03:52,039 --> 00:03:58,189
weight start exercising and changing

80
00:03:55,939 --> 00:04:00,489
your diet you need to take some take

81
00:03:58,189 --> 00:04:04,069
control of something for yourself and

82
00:04:00,489 --> 00:04:06,409
not only will this give you a project

83
00:04:04,069 --> 00:04:08,870
that it not theirs has nothing to do

84
00:04:06,409 --> 00:04:11,150
with that that is purely yours because

85
00:04:08,870 --> 00:04:15,049
you've already<font color="#E5E5E5"> been apart it's mine now</font>

86
00:04:11,150 --> 00:04:18,918
I'm going to lose 15 pounds but when

87
00:04:15,049 --> 00:04:21,530
they see you<font color="#E5E5E5"> 50 pounds lighter there's a</font>

88
00:04:18,918 --> 00:04:23,779
dissonant your daughter goes away for

89
00:04:21,529 --> 00:04:26,149
six months and comes back and she sees a

90
00:04:23,779 --> 00:04:30,168
slender Bob who's cooking vegetables

91
00:04:26,149 --> 00:04:31,788
instead of peanut butter<font color="#E5E5E5"> and jelly she</font>

92
00:04:30,168 --> 00:04:34,060
has to figure out how many to deal with

93
00:04:31,788 --> 00:04:37,750
this woman I don't I don't I don't see

94
00:04:34,060 --> 00:04:40,750
Batman anymore so I can't behave like

95
00:04:37,750 --> 00:04:40,750
rod

96
00:04:41,129 --> 00:04:45,490
figure you out changing the physical

<font color="#E5E5E5">appearance is going to be helpful</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> for</font>

98
00:04:45,490 --> 00:04:49,509
two things<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> change you because of your</font>

99
00:04:47,379 --> 00:04:51,399
habits and your discipline in that

100
00:04:49,509 --> 00:04:56,050
regard diet and exercise but they're

101
00:04:51,399 --> 00:04:59,348
also going to be differently towards it

102
00:04:56,050 --> 00:05:01,360
could be worth<font color="#E5E5E5"> trying you know the</font>

103
00:04:59,348 --> 00:05:03,848
deeper issue as to what might be a

104
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:06,788
challenge and<font color="#E5E5E5"> we've talked about</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it a</font>

105
00:05:03,848 --> 00:05:08,259
challenge to you losing that way could

106
00:05:06,788 --> 00:05:09,938
be<font color="#CCCCCC"> a different conversation but my</font>

107
00:05:08,259 --> 00:05:15,879
invitation would be give that attorney

115
00:05:35,040 --> 00:05:38,910
that's one thing my dad would always say

116
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:40,920
too because my mother's might be my

117

where you should have been<font color="#CCCCCC"> a good girl</font>

be a good girl and do what you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> told</font>

147
00:06:55,949 --> 00:07:03,490
that's this going up against that and

148
00:06:58,829 --> 00:07:05,800
that creates lots of tension it creates

149
00:07:03,490 --> 00:07:08,879
creates much more than that<font color="#E5E5E5"> but it's</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">get those tears out get them out the</font>

164
00:07:46,350 --> 00:07:53,090
get it out until these effects hoping to

00:07:48,300 --> 00:07:56,730
get out as anger you have you sadness

166
00:07:53,089 --> 00:07:58,500
frustration but it's coming<font color="#E5E5E5"> up as teams</font>

169
00:08:00,629 --> 00:08:08,670
deciding that holding back of the tears

170
00:08:04,920 --> 00:08:10,110
is the same holding back that it's not

171
00:08:08,670 --> 00:08:12,900
<font color="#E5E5E5">letting you do this so you literally</font>
