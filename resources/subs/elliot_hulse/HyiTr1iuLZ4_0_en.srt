168
00:06:54,668 --> 00:07:01,269
in general is not to be media so what<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

that are making just so<font color="#CCCCCC"> I can get</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> work</font>

191
00:07:45,728 --> 00:07:50,740
<font color="#E5E5E5">in second direction it's going to be how</font>

192
00:07:47,949 --> 00:07:54,038
I reached would you say 85 million

193
00:07:50,740 --> 00:07:58,509
people in your<font color="#CCCCCC"> online and sin I like</font>

194
00:07:54,038 --> 00:08:01,318
that that totally is is a monster

195
00:07:58,509 --> 00:08:04,360
jumping out of the closet going<font color="#E5E5E5"> boo yeah</font>

196

so when you say 85 million I'm like good

197
00:08:04,360 --> 00:08:11,620
whoa that's crazy and<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's not</font>

198
00:08:07,149 --> 00:08:13,000
pleasurable<font color="#E5E5E5"> it mystery yeah that's a</font>

199
00:08:11,620 --> 00:08:15,069
slow with it man it's so much cooler

200
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:18,848
than you could have played yeah exactly

201
00:08:15,069 --> 00:08:20,379
it now I think<font color="#CCCCCC"> after you buy willing to</font>

202
00:08:18,848 --> 00:08:22,750
take risks and<font color="#E5E5E5"> jumpy on every</font>

203
00:08:20,379 --> 00:08:25,718
<font color="#CCCCCC">opportunity you have you're telling that</font>

204
00:08:22,750 --> 00:08:28,478
God's Spirit give me more opportunities

205
00:08:25,718 --> 00:08:30,788
like you're saying if I take a risk you

206
00:08:28,478 --> 00:08:33,218
better have my back up there and it's

207
00:08:30,788 --> 00:08:35,259
like whatever force it is always has

208
00:08:33,219 --> 00:08:38,949
your back if you take the risk see

209
00:08:35,259 --> 00:08:40,750
having it<font color="#E5E5E5"> out of your back it's just</font>

210
00:08:38,948 --> 00:08:42,579
tricky thing because having my back

211
00:08:40,750 --> 00:08:44,169
means you're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to take care</font>

212
00:08:42,580 --> 00:08:46,450
in a way that I want you<font color="#CCCCCC"> to take care of</font>

213
00:08:44,169 --> 00:08:48,279
it right so if you go into a fight you

214
00:08:46,450 --> 00:08:50,440
say uh yeah what you got my back right

215
00:08:48,279 --> 00:08:52,329
that means you're calm down motherfucker

216
00:08:50,440 --> 00:08:55,990
you're gonna do to poach this dude right

217
00:08:52,330 --> 00:08:57,850
yeah but what<font color="#E5E5E5"> God has your back you have</font>

218
00:08:55,990 --> 00:09:00,730
to be detached from<font color="#E5E5E5"> how he's gonna have</font>

236
00:09:33,490 --> 00:09:38,019
now you're upset<font color="#E5E5E5"> because you thought i</font>

237
00:09:35,710 --> 00:09:39,580
was going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to uh to steer that car out of</font>

238
00:09:38,019 --> 00:09:41,889
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> way so you can get in car accident</font>

239
00:09:39,580 --> 00:09:43,420
yeah that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> your fault you were that you</font>

240
00:09:41,889 --> 00:09:46,449
<font color="#E5E5E5">were attached to some outcome that you</font>

241
00:09:43,419 --> 00:09:49,149
expected yeah see now some<font color="#CCCCCC"> people might</font>

242
00:09:46,450 --> 00:09:50,980
say<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's just a delusional mindset</font>

243
00:09:49,149 --> 00:09:54,100
that's pure positivity and that the

244
00:09:50,980 --> 00:09:55,810
world is really<font color="#E5E5E5"> chaos for</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> me</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I've just</font>

245
00:09:54,100 --> 00:09:58,180
had so many coincidences in my life and

246
00:09:55,809 --> 00:09:59,289
ups and downs<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm all my downs like</font>

247
00:09:58,179 --> 00:10:02,349
if I get<font color="#E5E5E5"> into a car crash or something</font>

248
00:09:59,289 --> 00:10:03,610
like just for<font color="#CCCCCC"> example the downs it's</font>

249
00:10:02,350 --> 00:10:05,830
<font color="#E5E5E5">always like there's some hidden lessons</font>

250
00:10:03,610 --> 00:10:07,750
in there so it's because what you're

251
00:10:05,830 --> 00:10:08,590
doing is you might<font color="#CCCCCC"> pull</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it it down but</font>

252
00:10:07,750 --> 00:10:10,870
what<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're doing is you're</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> being</font>

253
00:10:08,590 --> 00:10:13,300
sensitive because you can label

254
00:10:10,870 --> 00:10:16,029
something good or bad but you can also

255
00:10:13,299 --> 00:10:17,919
make something that's labeled bad good

256
00:10:16,029 --> 00:10:20,110
yeah so people<font color="#CCCCCC"> would be like oh</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> yeah</font>

257
00:10:17,919 --> 00:10:22,299
you're a positive thinker not

258
00:10:20,110 --> 00:10:24,009
necessarily<font color="#CCCCCC"> I just know that I could</font>

259
00:10:22,299 --> 00:10:26,589
choose how I'm going to respond to every

274
00:11:01,299 --> 00:11:11,438

00:11:21,339 --> 00:11:25,779
attachments and it goes you know good or

281
00:11:23,649 --> 00:11:29,350
bad so fear would be like an attachment

282
00:11:25,778 --> 00:11:31,419
to do not experience in certain things

283
00:11:29,350 --> 00:11:33,370
and I wouldn't<font color="#CCCCCC"> want to experience my</font>

329
00:13:30,899 --> 00:13:37,379
questions with the intent to pacify a

330
00:13:34,080 --> 00:13:39,780
particular ideal the audience<font color="#CCCCCC"> has</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> then</font>

334
00:13:44,610 --> 00:13:49,350
answer it didn't come from you it came

335
00:13:47,700 --> 00:13:51,770
from<font color="#CCCCCC"> information or it came from</font>

336
00:13:49,350 --> 00:13:54,659
prejudice came from a biases and ideas

337
00:13:51,769 --> 00:13:56,159
so when i reuploaded the video I you

338
00:13:54,659 --> 00:13:57,360
know I realized like you know past

339
00:13:56,159 --> 00:14:00,899
couple weeks I've been making videos

340
00:13:57,360 --> 00:14:03,029
from my head and I need to go back to my

341
00:14:00,899 --> 00:14:04,889
body<font color="#E5E5E5"> and I you know I did some</font>

342
00:14:03,029 --> 00:14:06,809
meditation and you know just<font color="#E5E5E5"> start</font>

00:14:04,889 --> 00:14:08,460
breathing deeply I was like okay cool

344
00:14:06,809 --> 00:14:12,929
get back to my body and then I

345
00:14:08,460 --> 00:14:14,970
represented the video is a more in a

346
00:14:12,929 --> 00:14:17,489
more real way that this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is the way I'm</font>

347

348
00:14:17,490 --> 00:14:21,180
mean it's right<font color="#E5E5E5"> doesn't mean it's wrong</font>

349
00:14:19,019 --> 00:14:23,819
doesn't mean you'll like it better yeah

350

00:17:22,619 --> 00:17:26,429
true you feel<font color="#E5E5E5"> it you don't eat it you</font>

425
00:17:24,959 --> 00:17:28,170
didn't read it somewhere<font color="#E5E5E5"> in a matched up</font>

426
00:17:26,430 --> 00:17:29,730
that's usually<font color="#CCCCCC"> what the people</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> who argue</font>

427
00:17:28,170 --> 00:17:30,779
with me the most are like well<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

428
00:17:29,730 --> 00:17:32,190
didn't match up with the book that I

429
00:17:30,779 --> 00:17:33,690
read or didn't match up with my parents

430
00:17:32,190 --> 00:17:36,240
<font color="#E5E5E5">said it didn't match up with my religion</font>

431
00:17:33,690 --> 00:17:38,759
doesn't match up with the school yeah

432
00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:41,700
but when you feel<font color="#CCCCCC"> something in you it's</font>

433
00:17:38,759 --> 00:17:43,619
now yours you just embodied it right so

434
00:17:41,700 --> 00:17:46,740
le ho said something you didn't agree

435
00:17:43,619 --> 00:17:49,169
with me you felt that and that means all

436
00:17:46,740 --> 00:17:52,710
i'm doing is inviting<font color="#CCCCCC"> you to awaken to</font>

437
00:17:49,170 --> 00:17:55,740
your own genius yeah I feel like lots of

438
00:17:52,710 --> 00:17:57,440
successful people and people<font color="#E5E5E5"> just kind</font>

439
00:17:55,740 --> 00:17:59,220
<font color="#E5E5E5">of put them on a pedestal and</font>

440
00:17:57,440 --> 00:18:00,960
successfully<font color="#E5E5E5"> about</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a bunch of yes men</font>

441
00:17:59,220 --> 00:18:02,400
that just surround them that but it

442
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:05,220
makes me retarded they'll be like<font color="#E5E5E5"> oh</font>

443
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:06,300
great advice like like maybe<font color="#E5E5E5"> it was</font>

444
00:18:05,220 --> 00:18:07,980
something you could do is just make a

445
00:18:06,299 --> 00:18:10,409
video we give you the most worst advice

446
00:18:07,980 --> 00:18:11,849
you possibly can yeah just<font color="#E5E5E5"> make it</font>

447
00:18:10,410 --> 00:18:13,650
really obvious and just like do

448
00:18:11,849 --> 00:18:14,969
experiment to see it like they're going

449
00:18:13,650 --> 00:18:16,050
<font color="#E5E5E5">to be some people that are just like yes</font>

450
00:18:14,970 --> 00:18:18,200
that's the best thing you've ever said

451
00:18:16,049 --> 00:18:22,409
let me<font color="#E5E5E5"> read configuration yeah like</font>

452
00:18:18,200 --> 00:18:24,750
<font color="#E5E5E5">really yeah it's like guys just doing</font>

453
00:18:22,410 --> 00:18:26,940
this prove a point that like don't

454
00:18:24,750 --> 00:18:29,819
blindly listen to me don't blame listen

455
00:18:26,940 --> 00:18:31,529
to anyone know what do you feel and our

456
00:18:29,819 --> 00:18:33,329
feelings are never wrong because

457
00:18:31,529 --> 00:18:35,910
<font color="#E5E5E5">sometimes I might say something that</font>

458
00:18:33,329 --> 00:18:38,759
perhaps is is authentic genuine comes

459
00:18:35,910 --> 00:18:40,560
from me it's true and I truly<font color="#CCCCCC"> believe</font>

460
00:18:38,759 --> 00:18:42,690
<font color="#E5E5E5">that this idea of truth is purely</font>

461
00:18:40,559 --> 00:18:43,859
subjective you know we have science tell

462
00:18:42,690 --> 00:18:45,870
us a lot of<font color="#CCCCCC"> things that we</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> have taught</font>

463
00:18:43,859 --> 00:18:48,209
science to like repeat science but

464
00:18:45,869 --> 00:18:49,799
truth is always subjective if you think

465
00:18:48,210 --> 00:18:52,170
Jesus Christ rose from the dead and

466
00:18:49,799 --> 00:18:53,970
walked on<font color="#E5E5E5"> water that's your truth dude I</font>

467
00:18:52,170 --> 00:18:56,970
mean you<font color="#CCCCCC"> don't need Sciences to tell you</font>

468
00:18:53,970 --> 00:18:59,970
yes or no if you believe it all right no

469
00:18:56,970 --> 00:19:01,740
it's not<font color="#E5E5E5"> my business to to dabble with</font>

470
00:18:59,970 --> 00:19:05,058
that you know but if i say something

471
00:19:01,740 --> 00:19:08,279
<font color="#E5E5E5">think that awakens of feeling in you</font>

472
00:19:05,058 --> 00:19:11,069
often times there's cognitive dissonance

473
00:19:08,279 --> 00:19:14,129
associate with<font color="#E5E5E5"> it because it takes a</font>

474
00:19:11,069 --> 00:19:15,359
stab at<font color="#E5E5E5"> your</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> your deeply held belief so</font>

475
00:19:14,130 --> 00:19:17,970
if<font color="#E5E5E5"> i say</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> something about your religion</font>

476
00:19:15,359 --> 00:19:20,759
yeah let's<font color="#E5E5E5"> say I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> challenged that lets</font>

477
00:19:17,970 --> 00:19:22,890
people go back with it people are you

478
00:19:20,759 --> 00:19:24,390
immediately you're you're gonna go to

479
00:19:22,890 --> 00:19:27,360
<font color="#E5E5E5">your body the very first response is</font>

480
00:19:24,390 --> 00:19:30,090
going to be visceral you just touched my

481
00:19:27,359 --> 00:19:31,769
body the asshole usually tightens up

482
00:19:30,089 --> 00:19:35,759
these are the typical physical responses

483
00:19:31,769 --> 00:19:37,950
to stress your become a tight ass anus

484
00:19:35,759 --> 00:19:40,500
tightened up belly's it tightens up

485
00:19:37,950 --> 00:19:42,630
breathing stops reaching down here into

486
00:19:40,500 --> 00:19:44,730
your pelvic<font color="#CCCCCC"> floor shoulders</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> hiked up</font>

487
00:19:42,630 --> 00:19:46,320
heart rate goes up so if you notice

488
00:19:44,730 --> 00:19:48,380
those things happening physiologically

489
00:19:46,319 --> 00:19:51,240
within you i just touched you and

490
00:19:48,380 --> 00:19:53,490
because<font color="#CCCCCC"> you got a visceral response to</font>

491
00:19:51,240 --> 00:19:56,730
something<font color="#E5E5E5"> that I that challenges your</font>

495
00:20:02,009 --> 00:20:06,390
thing if I didn't touch your body if I

496
00:20:04,740 --> 00:20:07,859
say something and you you're so

497
00:20:06,390 --> 00:20:09,509
conditioned in a way you don't feel

498
00:20:07,859 --> 00:20:10,649
<font color="#CCCCCC">anything and you just nod your head</font>

506
00:20:24,599 --> 00:20:29,369
lack of better terms or a lost cause

507
00:20:26,369 --> 00:20:31,678
they're not your person but someone who

508
00:20:29,369 --> 00:20:33,509
you touch<font color="#E5E5E5"> a visceral level and they're</font>

513
00:20:39,900 --> 00:20:44,580
one of your best fans in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the making</font>

514
00:20:42,299 --> 00:20:48,359
because<font color="#CCCCCC"> if they are courageous enough to</font>

515
00:20:44,579 --> 00:20:49,949
explore that feeling besides you you

516
00:20:48,359 --> 00:20:52,289
know it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not about you that violate</font>

517
00:20:49,950 --> 00:20:53,759
host if they explore that feeling on

518
00:20:52,289 --> 00:20:55,940
their own and they come to a new

519
00:20:53,759 --> 00:20:58,669
realization because they were curious

520
00:20:55,940 --> 00:21:01,788
enough about that gut reaction they'll

521
00:20:58,669 --> 00:21:03,620
come back later<font color="#E5E5E5"> and they're like you</font>
