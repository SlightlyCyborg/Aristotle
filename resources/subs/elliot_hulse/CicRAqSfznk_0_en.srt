00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,509
hey whats up guys one of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the things I've</font>

2
00:00:01,589 --> 00:00:05,819
<font color="#CCCCCC">been reminiscing on recently is the</font>

3
00:00:03,509 --> 00:00:07,740
timeline that it took<font color="#CCCCCC"> from me when I</font>

4
00:00:05,819 --> 00:00:11,280
first moved down to Florida and started

5
00:00:07,740 --> 00:00:13,169
my own business to where I<font color="#E5E5E5"> am right now</font>

6
00:00:11,279 --> 00:00:15,739
and I got<font color="#E5E5E5"> thinking about that because</font>

7
00:00:13,169 --> 00:00:19,769
<font color="#E5E5E5">last weekend I spent a lot</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of time with</font>

8
00:00:15,740 --> 00:00:21,390
brand new business people entrepreneurs

9
00:00:19,769 --> 00:00:23,518
<font color="#E5E5E5">people trying to come up in their life</font>

10
00:00:21,390 --> 00:00:25,289
even through fitness it was interesting

11
00:00:23,518 --> 00:00:27,689
to meet some people who<font color="#E5E5E5"> have lost over a</font>

12
00:00:25,289 --> 00:00:30,750
hundred<font color="#E5E5E5"> pounds so got me thinking</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> about</font>

13
00:00:27,689 --> 00:00:34,289
<font color="#E5E5E5">the time perspective or timeline with</font>

14
00:00:30,750 --> 00:00:36,929
regard to achieving your results in any

15
00:00:34,289 --> 00:00:39,089
realm of your life success in business

16
00:00:36,929 --> 00:00:41,899
success and fitness success and

17
00:00:39,090 --> 00:00:46,370
relationships takes a particular

18
00:00:41,899 --> 00:00:48,570
<font color="#E5E5E5">gestation period to bud and become so</font>

19
00:00:46,369 --> 00:00:51,179
one of the questions people typically

20
00:00:48,570 --> 00:00:52,829
ask is how much how long they want to

21
00:00:51,179 --> 00:00:55,289
know what is the<font color="#E5E5E5"> time frame between when</font>

22
00:00:52,829 --> 00:01:00,120
I get started<font color="#CCCCCC"> on my journey of weight</font>

23
00:00:55,289 --> 00:01:01,739
loss or building a business or trying to

24
00:01:00,119 --> 00:01:05,609
find a significant other to have

25
00:01:01,738 --> 00:01:07,859
relationship with and then start

26
00:01:05,609 --> 00:01:09,780
comparing ourselves to those<font color="#E5E5E5"> who are</font>

27
00:01:07,859 --> 00:01:11,159
already there and I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think that's one of</font>

28
00:01:09,780 --> 00:01:12,868
<font color="#E5E5E5">the most dangerous things that we end up</font>

29
00:01:11,159 --> 00:01:14,340
<font color="#CCCCCC">doing it's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> not fair to ourselves and</font>

30
00:01:12,868 --> 00:01:16,049
it's not fair<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the person that we're</font>

31
00:01:14,340 --> 00:01:17,969
comparing ourselves to comparing is

32
00:01:16,049 --> 00:01:19,320
never fair to the person you're

33
00:01:17,969 --> 00:01:21,150
comparing yourself to of course<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's</font>

34
00:01:19,319 --> 00:01:22,829
<font color="#E5E5E5">very obvious because for yourself</font>

35
00:01:21,150 --> 00:01:25,439
<font color="#CCCCCC">because well why should you compare</font>

36
00:01:22,829 --> 00:01:28,560
yourself to someone who is experiencing

37
00:01:25,438 --> 00:01:30,618
life different than you they come<font color="#E5E5E5"> from a</font>

38
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:33,150
different circumstance have different

39
00:01:30,618 --> 00:01:35,219
environments they're different DNA

40
00:01:33,150 --> 00:01:37,710
they're just different for us to compare

41
00:01:35,219 --> 00:01:39,179
ourselves<font color="#E5E5E5"> is silly for ourselves but</font>

42
00:01:37,709 --> 00:01:41,219
it's all so silly for the other person

43
00:01:39,180 --> 00:01:44,240
because when we compare ourselves to

44
00:01:41,219 --> 00:01:47,009
other people we hold them as an object

45
00:01:44,239 --> 00:01:48,899
right<font color="#CCCCCC"> everybody's very objective to us</font>

46
00:01:47,009 --> 00:01:51,390
but this<font color="#E5E5E5"> person in particular we hold as</font>

47
00:01:48,899 --> 00:01:53,189
an object<font color="#E5E5E5"> there they are there's where I</font>

48
00:01:51,390 --> 00:01:56,310
want to be and then we begin analyzing

49
00:01:53,188 --> 00:01:58,798
them as if you know somehow there's a

50
00:01:56,310 --> 00:02:01,259
hidden trick to them being where they

51
00:01:58,799 --> 00:02:02,610
happen to be well they're exactly where

52
00:02:01,259 --> 00:02:05,310
they need to be<font color="#E5E5E5"> because the universe</font>

53
00:02:02,609 --> 00:02:06,509
<font color="#E5E5E5">works that way God decided upon it and</font>

54
00:02:05,310 --> 00:02:08,628
you're exactly where you need to be

55
00:02:06,509 --> 00:02:11,960
<font color="#E5E5E5">because the universe has placed you here</font>

56
00:02:08,628 --> 00:02:15,949

57
00:02:11,960 --> 00:02:17,240
perfect time for you so one of the

things<font color="#E5E5E5"> that I wanted to share with you</font>

59
00:02:17,240 --> 00:02:25,100
today is how to take a practical

60
00:02:22,250 --> 00:02:30,530
approach to achieving your goals with

61
00:02:25,099 --> 00:02:32,449
regard to<font color="#CCCCCC"> time line now I am one of the</font>

62
00:02:30,530 --> 00:02:33,439
first people<font color="#CCCCCC"> i'm</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> in aries by the way and</font>

63
00:02:32,449 --> 00:02:35,889
if you know that I kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of pay attention</font>

64
00:02:33,439 --> 00:02:40,069
to astrology and Aries is a fire sign

65
00:02:35,889 --> 00:02:42,759
fiery people want shit fast we burn with

66
00:02:40,069 --> 00:02:44,840
desire we want to go full speed ahead

67
00:02:42,759 --> 00:02:47,919
<font color="#E5E5E5">immediately and we want the fucking</font>

68
00:02:44,840 --> 00:02:50,719
thing now of course that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> a cultural</font>

69
00:02:47,919 --> 00:02:52,759
idea everybody in the United States or

70
00:02:50,719 --> 00:02:54,710
in Western culture or just in culture at

71
00:02:52,759 --> 00:02:58,489
large in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> world is wanting things</font>

72
00:02:54,710 --> 00:03:02,180
faster now but it's deeply ingrained in

73
00:02:58,490 --> 00:03:05,689
my DNA I don't have patience as an

74
00:03:02,180 --> 00:03:08,210
inherent virtue I want things<font color="#E5E5E5"> now I want</font>

75
00:03:05,689 --> 00:03:11,479
things fast and I'm willing it to tear

00:03:08,210 --> 00:03:13,580
my body apart tear my mind apart to get

77
00:03:11,479 --> 00:03:16,869
it in fact it's kind of what I did<font color="#E5E5E5"> I've</font>

78
00:03:13,580 --> 00:03:19,940
injured myself and by being impatient

79
00:03:16,870 --> 00:03:24,050
but I wanted<font color="#E5E5E5"> to share my experience with</font>

107
00:04:33,689 --> 00:04:40,719
about five years later if you notice in

108
00:04:37,478 --> 00:04:43,509
the graph there's a long period of very

low subscriber activity what you're

would skip a week or two but

115
00:04:59,139 --> 00:05:04,168
consistently made videos for five years

116
00:05:01,660 --> 00:05:07,810
building my business building my family

117
00:05:04,168 --> 00:05:10,060
growing my relationship with my wife<font color="#E5E5E5"> all</font>

118
00:05:07,810 --> 00:05:14,949
along that time but ultimately it took

119
00:05:10,060 --> 00:05:18,579
five years of hard work grinding to hit

120
00:05:14,949 --> 00:05:21,038
that critical point where it seemed as

121
00:05:18,579 --> 00:05:23,800
if it was overnight success if you look

122
00:05:21,038 --> 00:05:26,519
at 2013 it seems as if where the hell<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

123
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:28,930
this guy come from overnight success

124
00:05:26,519 --> 00:05:32,889
well it was an overnight success<font color="#E5E5E5"> then it</font>

125
00:05:28,930 --> 00:05:37,660
was a five-year night that took<font color="#E5E5E5"> me</font>

through before<font color="#E5E5E5"> the Sun rose I think this</font>

offers a<font color="#E5E5E5"> little bit of perspective for</font>

131
00:05:46,930 --> 00:05:52,478
because during that five years I

132
00:05:49,060 --> 00:05:54,728
literally had to transform who I was you

133
