00:00:12,019 --> 00:00:17,359
<font color="#CCCCCC">started and embark upon this campaign</font>

00:00:15,769 --> 00:00:19,129
for non jobs cuz everybody's talking

8
00:00:22,278 --> 00:00:26,809
the big issue is jobs fuck the jobs i

want to show you how to<font color="#CCCCCC"> create a non job</font>

10
00:00:26,809 --> 00:00:30,919
in a non job lifestyle just like<font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font>

11
00:00:28,879 --> 00:00:32,799
described in the video last week where

12
00:00:30,920 --> 00:00:36,079
you share the things that you love and

13
00:00:32,799 --> 00:00:37,998
you get paid very well to do it so

14
00:00:36,079 --> 00:00:40,579
before we embark and<font color="#E5E5E5"> before i invite you</font>

15
00:00:37,999 --> 00:00:43,370
on that campaign for non jobs i want to

16
00:00:40,579 --> 00:00:44,719
give you three<font color="#CCCCCC"> reasons</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> why you need</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

17
00:00:43,369 --> 00:00:48,558
shut this video off and completely

18
00:00:44,719 --> 00:00:49,819
forget the idea of creating<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> non job</font>

19
00:00:48,558 --> 00:00:50,829
lifestyle for yourself because i don't

00:00:49,819 --> 00:00:52,699
want<font color="#CCCCCC"> to blow smoke up your ass</font>

21
00:00:50,829 --> 00:00:54,228
everything I spoke<font color="#CCCCCC"> about in that video</font>

22
00:00:52,698 --> 00:00:56,568
last week came from the bottom of my

23
00:00:54,228 --> 00:00:58,039
heart<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> hundred</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> percent true but</font>

24
00:00:56,569 --> 00:01:01,850
there are three things that you<font color="#E5E5E5"> need</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

25
00:00:58,039 --> 00:01:03,798
know<font color="#E5E5E5"> before you decide to step foot on</font>

26
00:01:01,850 --> 00:01:05,509
this journey the very first<font color="#CCCCCC"> one is that</font>

27
00:01:03,798 --> 00:01:06,890
<font color="#CCCCCC">there are</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> no guarantees there's</font>

28
00:01:05,509 --> 00:01:08,718
<font color="#CCCCCC">absolutely no guarantee that you're</font>

00:01:08,718 --> 00:01:15,530
is conjuring up right now so<font color="#E5E5E5"> you may or</font>

31
00:01:12,319 --> 00:01:17,089
may not become a millionaire by creating

33
00:01:17,090 --> 00:01:22,789
but I have friends who within<font color="#E5E5E5"> three to</font>

six months<font color="#CCCCCC"> earn their first million</font>

35
00:01:22,789 --> 00:01:28,099

00:01:25,968 --> 00:01:30,078
non jobs I don't want to say they're

37
00:01:28,099 --> 00:01:33,169
lucky but that was in the cards for them

38
00:01:30,078 --> 00:01:35,029
the way things<font color="#E5E5E5"> were and the market they</font>

39
00:01:33,170 --> 00:01:37,939
chose to<font color="#CCCCCC"> serve and the way they chose to</font>

00:01:37,938 --> 00:01:41,868

of my non job having<font color="#E5E5E5"> friends that might</font>

46
00:01:49,188 --> 00:01:53,328
happen like I<font color="#CCCCCC"> said I'm not a millionaire</font>

47
00:01:50,840 --> 00:01:55,899
that didn't happen for me my journey is

quite<font color="#E5E5E5"> different but I have a very</font>

54
00:02:06,090 --> 00:02:10,050
friends of mine as well who have been

55
00:02:08,189 --> 00:02:12,300
doing this just as long<font color="#CCCCCC"> as I have that</font>

56
00:02:10,050 --> 00:02:15,330
are still struggling the way they're

57
00:02:12,300 --> 00:02:17,310
serving their market is it just hasn't

58

clicked yet for them it may never<font color="#E5E5E5"> click</font>

59
00:02:17,310 --> 00:02:22,170
for them but they're more attached the

60
00:02:19,709 --> 00:02:23,878
idea of freedom than they are safety and

61
00:02:22,169 --> 00:02:25,589
security they're more attached to the

62
00:02:23,878 --> 00:02:27,870
journey and<font color="#CCCCCC"> the personal development</font>

63
00:02:25,590 --> 00:02:29,909
associated with living a non job

lifestyle<font color="#CCCCCC"> than the guarantee of any</font>

65
00:02:29,909 --> 00:02:35,729
types of riches so if you need to make

66
00:02:32,340 --> 00:02:37,950
six or seven figures and that guarantee

67
00:02:35,729 --> 00:02:39,629
needs to be set in stone for<font color="#CCCCCC"> you then</font>

68

this is not for you this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> not for you</font>

70
00:02:41,129 --> 00:02:45,209
guarantee is to go and look for a job

71
00:02:42,989 --> 00:02:47,579
that guarantees a paycheck from week to

72

why you should<font color="#E5E5E5"> shut this video off</font>

guarantee I have four children<font color="#E5E5E5"> I started</font>

remember several times that my car would

break down and I'd have to stop pull

99
00:03:48,030 --> 00:03:52,949
over and walk because I had no<font color="#CCCCCC"> money for</font>

143
00:05:43,560 --> 00:05:47,908
<font color="#E5E5E5">that I have can be taken from me right</font>

144
00:05:45,478 --> 00:05:49,740
<font color="#CCCCCC">now I can be left with nothing but ten</font>

145
00:05:47,908 --> 00:05:51,000
dollars in my pocket and I can get up

146
00:05:49,740 --> 00:05:53,939
and create a non job lifestyle for

147
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:55,259
myself in a matter of months those are

148
00:05:53,939 --> 00:05:56,819
the skills that are going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to offer you</font>

00:05:55,259 --> 00:05:59,430
safety and security not a<font color="#E5E5E5"> fucking</font>

150
00:05:56,819 --> 00:06:01,829
paycheck and finally the third reason

151
00:05:59,430 --> 00:06:05,129
why you should not join us in the

152
00:06:01,829 --> 00:06:08,370
campaign for non jobs is you're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

154
00:06:08,370 --> 00:06:12,060
<font color="#E5E5E5">lonely for several months or even years</font>

155
00:06:10,589 --> 00:06:13,859
because your friends aren't going to

156
00:06:12,060 --> 00:06:17,189
understand what you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> doing they're</font>

166
00:06:32,029 --> 00:06:35,179
they belong in the<font color="#CCCCCC"> cloud somewhere</font>

167
00:06:33,470 --> 00:06:37,340
you're going to be doing shit that they

tell me Elliot why don't you go get a

173
00:06:45,560 --> 00:06:50,110
job as a hospital administrator because

00:06:54,889 --> 00:07:00,500
and upstanding join society and it

178
00:06:57,800 --> 00:07:02,240
wasn't that my mom didn't care for me

179
00:07:00,500 --> 00:07:03,769
the fact is that she cared for<font color="#E5E5E5"> me so</font>

180
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:06,050
<font color="#CCCCCC">much that she didn't want to see me in</font>

181
00:07:03,769 --> 00:07:12,519
this place where there's no safety and

00:07:06,050 --> 00:07:15,918
security and I decided<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> if I have to</font>
