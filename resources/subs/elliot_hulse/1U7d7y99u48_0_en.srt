00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:35,280
it's very<font color="#E5E5E5"> difficult to become self</font>

of the finger the other one is to point

65

you in direction that you may not have

66
00:02:57,870 --> 00:03:04,080

lot of ideas I have no a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot of courage</font>

68
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:08,400
with regard to what I will think about
