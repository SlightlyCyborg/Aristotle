keep doing over here the worse it's

mentally point the same courage that<font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font>

93
00:04:07,409 --> 00:04:11,219
took to go down this journey is the same

94
00:04:09,539 --> 00:04:13,199
goes it took courage to be the type of

95
00:04:11,219 --> 00:04:14,879
athlete that you are we all have courage

96
00:04:13,199 --> 00:04:16,589
we just<font color="#E5E5E5"> forget</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that we have courage</font>

97
00:04:14,879 --> 00:04:17,790
especially when we get what we want are

98
00:04:16,589 --> 00:04:20,129
you really good as an athlete miss

99
00:04:17,790 --> 00:04:22,500
direction everything they got you what

100
00:04:20,129 --> 00:04:24,810
you want to hear all the<font color="#E5E5E5"> glory of the</font>

00:04:22,500 --> 00:04:27,930
pride associated with what you got here

102
00:04:24,810 --> 00:04:30,120
required some courage so it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> hard to</font>

103
00:04:27,930 --> 00:04:33,389
detach from the version<font color="#E5E5E5"> of yourself that</font>

104
00:04:30,120 --> 00:04:35,399
got you here in order<font color="#E5E5E5"> to recreate a new</font>

00:04:33,389 --> 00:04:38,090
version of<font color="#E5E5E5"> yourself by doing the exact</font>

106
00:04:35,399 --> 00:04:40,829
opposite which is chill the fuck out

107
00:04:38,089 --> 00:04:44,279
literally oportunidad but you've got to

108
00:04:40,829 --> 00:04:47,099
let go<font color="#E5E5E5"> for a time of this character</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> this</font>

109
00:04:44,279 --> 00:04:49,559
character<font color="#CCCCCC"> is fit fit and firm and</font>

110
00:04:47,100 --> 00:04:52,080
beautiful and all the<font color="#CCCCCC"> things that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font>

112
00:04:52,079 --> 00:04:58,109
maybe you back sick and<font color="#CCCCCC"> tired strange</font>

113
00:04:55,829 --> 00:04:59,879
right these all these<font color="#E5E5E5"> things got me what</font>

114
00:04:58,110 --> 00:05:01,710
I wanted but now thats the point

115
00:04:59,879 --> 00:05:03,629
intimidation like mentally<font color="#CCCCCC"> i find it</font>

116
00:05:01,709 --> 00:05:06,449
makes you so much of a<font color="#E5E5E5"> stronger person</font>

117
00:05:03,629 --> 00:05:08,310
and then i<font color="#E5E5E5"> think one of the weakest</font>

118
00:05:06,449 --> 00:05:11,490
times of my life was when I was

119
00:05:08,310 --> 00:05:14,569
<font color="#CCCCCC">that's like yeah you went off the</font>

120
00:05:11,490 --> 00:05:18,240
<font color="#E5E5E5">boundary that's why this looks like this</font>

121
00:05:14,569 --> 00:05:21,719
because you go too far this way you're

122
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:25,259
going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be forced back this way it's</font>

123
00:05:21,720 --> 00:05:28,890
like watering right yeah it needs water

124
00:05:25,259 --> 00:05:31,889
right exactly what you just drownded you

125
00:05:28,889 --> 00:05:34,500
went too far that<font color="#CCCCCC"> you what you're</font>

126
00:05:31,889 --> 00:05:36,719
getting<font color="#E5E5E5"> is the exact opposite</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> look you</font>

127
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:40,259
got what you do it right you probably

128
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:43,170
need to<font color="#E5E5E5"> take a whole year</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to restructure</font>

your lifestyle your opinion by<font color="#E5E5E5"> building</font>

130
00:05:43,170 --> 00:05:51,689
up more arrows and you might<font color="#CCCCCC"> find that</font>

131
00:05:45,269 --> 00:05:55,019
you get better<font color="#E5E5E5"> results you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> would rather</font>

132
00:05:51,689 --> 00:05:57,480

00:06:28,110 --> 00:06:34,620
completely switch your mind of thinking

146
00:06:30,180 --> 00:06:36,840
that that on stage presence where you're

147
00:06:34,620 --> 00:06:39,899
at eight percent body fat is the

148
00:06:36,839 --> 00:06:43,259
stereotypical walking model of health

149
00:06:39,899 --> 00:06:45,539
because it's not all it is is you're

150

155
00:06:52,410 --> 00:06:58,110
you're like what yeah like basically how

156
00:06:56,189 --> 00:07:01,399

aggressive too much no because you know

163

166
00:07:54,899 --> 00:08:00,539
energy in that necessarily sexuality but

167
00:07:57,629 --> 00:08:04,259
a very aggressive male woman has a hard

168
00:08:00,540 --> 00:08:08,879
time keeping an aggressive man tends to
