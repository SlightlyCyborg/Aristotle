teeth will rot gums will go bad and and

23
00:01:03,479 --> 00:01:08,368
when your teeth go bad your mouth starts

24
00:01:05,879 --> 00:01:09,899
to rot your whole body begins to rot

25
00:01:08,368 --> 00:01:12,420
people don't think about it<font color="#E5E5E5"> that way but</font>

26
00:01:09,900 --> 00:01:14,640
your mouth is the gateway to your

00:01:24,688 --> 00:01:30,269
<font color="#CCCCCC">about our intestines recently in regard</font>

41
00:01:49,799 --> 00:01:54,720
what health really is but we leave

certain things in the shadow like our

43
00:01:54,719 --> 00:02:00,899
mouths and our rectums those are those

44
00:01:57,450 --> 00:02:04,710
are key gateways to our help right we

71
00:03:12,840 --> 00:03:17,069

don't brush regularly you don't floss

73

161
00:06:51,079 --> 00:06:55,849

162
00:06:52,730 --> 00:06:57,620
not<font color="#E5E5E5"> a major core value of mine I really</font>

you know it's not<font color="#E5E5E5"> something I care much</font>

167
00:07:03,740 --> 00:07:08,420
treating him right and somebody says

176
00:07:23,829 --> 00:07:29,359
fashion clothing is not a core value of

00:07:26,360 --> 00:07:33,379
mine but still get the respect and

178

185
00:07:53,629 --> 00:07:58,040
all the nice things that civilization

00:07:55,579 --> 00:08:00,680
can afford iPhones right that I'm

187
00:07:58,040 --> 00:08:03,650
talking<font color="#CCCCCC"> to you on this the paved streets</font>

188
00:08:00,680 --> 00:08:05,120
the cars the building's the boats that

are on the<font color="#E5E5E5"> other</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> side of the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> camera they</font>

190
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:10,550
all come<font color="#CCCCCC"> from other people right so the</font>

191
00:08:08,480 --> 00:08:13,100
attitude that I don't care what anybody

192
00:08:10,550 --> 00:08:15,079
thinks I don't care what<font color="#E5E5E5"> anybody says I</font>

193
00:08:13,100 --> 00:08:18,590
don't care what anybody does it's great

194
00:08:15,079 --> 00:08:20,750
for protecting yourself from when you

195
00:08:18,589 --> 00:08:22,069
should be protecting yourself you know

196
00:08:20,750 --> 00:08:25,180
there are<font color="#E5E5E5"> times when you've got is you</font>

197
00:08:22,069 --> 00:08:27,860
got to be a staunch self-reliance

198
00:08:25,180 --> 00:08:30,079
libertarian you got to see things fit

199
00:08:27,860 --> 00:08:32,089
for yourself and you got to<font color="#E5E5E5"> do what's</font>

200
00:08:30,079 --> 00:08:34,968
right<font color="#E5E5E5"> for you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and your mission but at</font>

201
00:08:32,089 --> 00:08:39,800
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> same time we've got to balance that</font>

202
00:08:34,969 --> 00:08:44,060
with the fact that we've chosen<font color="#E5E5E5"> this day</font>

203
00:08:39,799 --> 00:08:46,458
age time in place it's my conviction we

204
00:08:44,059 --> 00:08:49,369
choose our circumstances by which you

205
00:08:46,458 --> 00:08:52,549
become born into circumstances that we

206
00:08:49,370 --> 00:08:54,709
show up in this stuff is life with you

207
00:08:52,549 --> 00:08:55,909
chose to show up in civilization that

208
00:08:54,708 --> 00:08:58,159
means you're<font color="#CCCCCC"> going to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> have to play by</font>

209
00:08:55,909 --> 00:09:00,078
some of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the rules and if you choose not</font>

210
00:08:58,159 --> 00:09:03,769
to play by the<font color="#E5E5E5"> rules you're just going</font>

211
00:09:00,078 --> 00:09:09,708
to simply pay the price<font color="#E5E5E5"> and if you want</font>

212
00:09:03,769 --> 00:09:11,389
to have the luxury of people looking<font color="#E5E5E5"> at</font>

213
00:09:09,708 --> 00:09:13,278
you a certain way you know with

214
00:09:11,389 --> 00:09:16,370
admiration and respect you gotta dress

215
00:09:13,278 --> 00:09:18,230
respectfully that's really that's really

216
00:09:16,370 --> 00:09:20,600
the long and short of it and<font color="#CCCCCC"> now it</font>

217
00:09:18,230 --> 00:09:22,459
sounds shallow because it is but<font color="#E5E5E5"> people</font>

218
00:09:20,600 --> 00:09:24,079
can't see your depths people can't see

219
00:09:22,458 --> 00:09:27,708
how beautiful you are people can't see

220
00:09:24,078 --> 00:09:29,149
the your heart on the outside all they

221
00:09:27,708 --> 00:09:31,250
can see is your eye<font color="#E5E5E5"> out you're</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> outside</font>

222
00:09:29,149 --> 00:09:32,958
and you<font color="#E5E5E5"> got</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to respect that unless</font>

223
00:09:31,250 --> 00:09:35,539
someone is sensitive enough to feel your

224
00:09:32,958 --> 00:09:39,229
vibrations which most of us are not to

225
00:09:35,539 --> 00:09:42,169
feel your goodness to sense your dignity

226
00:09:39,230 --> 00:09:44,058
the sense your self-esteem rather than

227
00:09:42,169 --> 00:09:50,509
see it on your clothes or see it on your

228
00:09:44,058 --> 00:09:57,588
face unless that was the case what kind

229
00:09:50,509 --> 00:10:00,169
of trapped our outside sends vibrations

230
00:09:57,589 --> 00:10:02,269
into the insides of other people people

231
00:10:00,169 --> 00:10:07,808
judge you you<font color="#E5E5E5"> will be</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> judged by the</font>

232
00:10:02,269 --> 00:10:11,808
clothing that you wear like a part of

233
00:10:07,808 --> 00:10:14,208
successful living also is uh deciding

234
00:10:11,808 --> 00:10:16,969
what kind of judgments were willing<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

235
00:10:14,208 --> 00:10:20,000
accept right people<font color="#CCCCCC"> when people judge me</font>

236
00:10:16,970 --> 00:10:21,769
when<font color="#E5E5E5"> I was 250 pounds with a mohawk and</font>

237
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:26,769
wore nothing but black strengthcamp

238
00:10:21,769 --> 00:10:29,240
t-shirts and carried a scowl on my face

239
00:10:26,769 --> 00:10:32,750
ten years<font color="#CCCCCC"> ago when I was being that</font>

240
00:10:29,240 --> 00:10:34,879
person and people judged me accordingly

241
00:10:32,750 --> 00:10:37,639
I had to be<font color="#E5E5E5"> all</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> right with it I had to</font>

242
00:10:34,879 --> 00:10:39,980
be like<font color="#CCCCCC"> yes I get it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I know I can't go</font>

243
00:10:37,639 --> 00:10:42,558
<font color="#CCCCCC">into this building I can't attend this</font>

244
00:10:39,980 --> 00:10:44,839
function I can't speak<font color="#CCCCCC"> to these people</font>

245
00:10:42,558 --> 00:10:46,639
because they're gonna have a hard time

246
00:10:44,839 --> 00:10:47,959
receiving me the way I look but<font color="#CCCCCC"> I was</font>

247
00:10:46,639 --> 00:10:49,399
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay with it you see you got to be okay</font>

248
00:10:47,958 --> 00:10:52,549
with<font color="#CCCCCC"> it you're dressing like a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> fucking</font>

249
00:10:49,399 --> 00:10:55,039
bum and you okay with it<font color="#E5E5E5"> and that's fine</font>

250
00:10:52,549 --> 00:10:57,558
<font color="#CCCCCC">Hey look if you got a nasty mouth full</font>

251
00:10:55,039 --> 00:10:59,299
of rotten teeth and you okay with it

252
00:10:57,558 --> 00:11:01,578
<font color="#E5E5E5">then that's fine that's really</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the only</font>

253
00:10:59,299 --> 00:11:03,620
question that matters to be completely

254
00:11:01,578 --> 00:11:06,169
honest these videos are actually like

255
00:11:03,620 --> 00:11:08,568
kind of stream of consciousness rants so

256
00:11:06,169 --> 00:11:10,490
am i contradict myself or talking

257
00:11:08,568 --> 00:11:15,349
<font color="#CCCCCC">circles but it's really</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> just me thinking</font>

258
00:11:10,490 --> 00:11:18,198
out loud so dealing<font color="#E5E5E5"> with other people</font>

259
00:11:15,350 --> 00:11:19,730
and civilization means dealing<font color="#E5E5E5"> with</font>

260
00:11:18,198 --> 00:11:22,519
people in the peripheral level dealing

261
00:11:19,730 --> 00:11:24,949
with people on your on your outside

262
00:11:22,519 --> 00:11:26,120
because that's really where you show up

263
00:11:24,948 --> 00:11:33,109
and that's really where you receive

264
00:11:26,120 --> 00:11:35,568
people you regardless of how righteous

265
00:11:33,110 --> 00:11:37,519
you are in your judgments of people or

266
00:11:35,568 --> 00:11:40,250
you believe you're gonna judge people by

267
00:11:37,519 --> 00:11:42,649
the way they look you do it I do it

268
00:11:40,250 --> 00:11:44,149
human beings do it it's a survival

269
00:11:42,649 --> 00:11:46,100
mechanism we did it so that we could

270
00:11:44,149 --> 00:11:50,958
judge whether or not a person place or

271
00:11:46,100 --> 00:11:52,428
circumstance is safe for us so you got

272
00:11:50,958 --> 00:11:53,808
<font color="#CCCCCC">it you have to be with that be all right</font>

273
00:11:52,428 --> 00:11:55,549
with that and<font color="#CCCCCC"> then you gotta</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> check it in</font>

274
00:11:53,808 --> 00:11:57,799
yourself to you<font color="#CCCCCC"> got recognized like you</font>

275
00:11:55,549 --> 00:11:59,479
are judging your judging machine I am a

276
00:11:57,799 --> 00:12:02,419
judgment machine we're a judgment

277
00:11:59,480 --> 00:12:05,659
mechanism so recognize when judgments or

278
00:12:02,419 --> 00:12:10,208
snap judgments based on past experiences

279
00:12:05,659 --> 00:12:13,370
and prejudice or or is it a deep sense

280
00:12:10,208 --> 00:12:14,838
judgment of someone right I<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't like</font>

281
00:12:13,370 --> 00:12:17,448
this person<font color="#E5E5E5"> like I spoke</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> about yesterday</font>

282
00:12:14,839 --> 00:12:20,000
some people who had the judgment I just

283
00:12:17,448 --> 00:12:21,948
don't he irks me hurts my feelings when

284
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:23,190
I see him and that requires<font color="#E5E5E5"> that we take</font>

285
00:12:21,948 --> 00:12:26,490
a look at<font color="#E5E5E5"> our self</font>
