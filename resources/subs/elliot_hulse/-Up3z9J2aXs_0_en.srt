00:08:12,620 --> 00:08:18,790

they just out of the grand rain and wind

153
00:08:40,158 --> 00:08:45,439
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay I trust you so I'm doing so I</font>

154
00:08:43,458 --> 00:08:49,088
listened<font color="#CCCCCC"> to these cities for every study</font>

155
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:51,649
single day for about<font color="#E5E5E5"> 30</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> days and</font>

156
00:08:49,089 --> 00:08:54,829
normally my behavior was neurotic you

157
00:08:51,649 --> 00:08:55,970
know thinking going<font color="#E5E5E5"> up doing and it's</font>

158
00:08:54,828 --> 00:08:57,828
always coming from a place of

159
00:08:55,970 --> 00:09:01,339
nervousness it's always more fun place

160
00:08:57,828 --> 00:09:02,809
of survival so one day I'm sitting down

161
00:09:01,339 --> 00:09:05,990
after I've<font color="#CCCCCC"> been doing for a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> while sit</font>

162
00:09:02,809 --> 00:09:09,708
down on the couch<font color="#CCCCCC"> and there's no tension</font>

163
00:09:05,990 --> 00:09:15,278
in my body I'm breathing relaxed not

164
00:09:09,708 --> 00:09:15,278
worry buddy and I freaked out

165
00:09:19,149 --> 00:09:24,610
what's going on I felt so weird because

166
00:09:21,909 --> 00:09:26,769
I was relaxed it was no tension in my

167
00:09:24,610 --> 00:09:28,480
body I don't know why oh and not<font color="#E5E5E5"> only</font>

168
00:09:26,769 --> 00:09:30,460
that because what happens is neuron

169
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:31,930
<font color="#CCCCCC">patterns like this if there</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is no</font>

170

tension in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> body your brain antenna</font>

171
00:09:31,929 --> 00:09:35,649
<font color="#CCCCCC">feel like we were increasing attention</font>

172
00:09:33,580 --> 00:09:39,009
because you're in a constant sympathetic

173
00:09:35,649 --> 00:09:40,959
state and to become due soon and<font color="#CCCCCC"> he's</font>

187
00:10:13,330 --> 00:10:21,639

188
00:10:17,460 --> 00:10:23,980
jockey you<font color="#CCCCCC"> follow my analogies the</font>

189

jockey let go<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the reins and the horse</font>

190
00:10:23,980 --> 00:10:31,240
started galloping but the horse was a

191
00:10:27,460 --> 00:10:33,610
fucking beautiful brilliant Beast that

192
00:10:31,240 --> 00:10:35,139
knew where to go what to do so the

193
00:10:33,610 --> 00:10:37,840
minute that the job he realized that he

194
00:10:35,139 --> 00:10:43,259
let go of the<font color="#CCCCCC"> reins you freaked out you</font>

195
00:10:37,840 --> 00:10:43,259
<font color="#E5E5E5">who's going continues like grains</font>

197
00:10:47,409 --> 00:10:54,519
ground again then<font color="#CCCCCC"> you realize the jockey</font>

198
00:10:49,269 --> 00:10:57,600
goes horse is doing pretty good did a

199
00:10:54,519 --> 00:11:01,389
good job and started fighting here and

200
00:10:57,600 --> 00:11:03,670
any time<font color="#CCCCCC"> I stop meditating I started</font>

201
00:11:01,389 --> 00:11:06,250
going like this try to grab<font color="#E5E5E5"> wings again</font>

202
00:11:03,669 --> 00:11:09,009
and you know what happens when I got the

203
00:11:06,250 --> 00:11:10,539
reins divorce and I'm stressed<font color="#E5E5E5"> out</font>

204
00:11:09,009 --> 00:11:12,429
because I'm trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to steer this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> one</font>

205
00:11:10,539 --> 00:11:14,259
horse the horse is<font color="#E5E5E5"> not able to do what</font>

206
00:11:12,429 --> 00:11:15,459
it wants to do because<font color="#CCCCCC"> of course is</font>

207
00:11:14,259 --> 00:11:16,450
brilliant and<font color="#E5E5E5"> the horse feels better</font>

208
00:11:15,460 --> 00:11:18,179
than the jockey because the horse

209
00:11:16,450 --> 00:11:22,079
understand

210
00:11:18,178 --> 00:11:25,358
follow my analogies are probably to do

211
00:11:22,078 --> 00:11:28,899
so through the meditation<font color="#E5E5E5"> I was able to</font>

212
00:11:25,359 --> 00:11:33,788
let go<font color="#E5E5E5"> and when I let go and let the</font>

213
00:11:28,899 --> 00:11:35,828
force steer the direction take me where

214
00:11:33,788 --> 00:11:37,328
I was<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to go and I'm scary stuff</font>

215
00:11:35,828 --> 00:11:40,208
because the horse is asking me to do

216
00:11:37,328 --> 00:11:43,118
some weird shit like a horse told me the

217
00:11:40,208 --> 00:11:45,238
horse head hey honey<font color="#E5E5E5"> you don't have</font>

218
00:11:43,119 --> 00:11:47,769
<font color="#E5E5E5">enough on your bread right now but I</font>

219
00:11:45,239 --> 00:11:49,298
think<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> can come up with two thousand</font>

220
00:11:47,769 --> 00:11:51,519
dollars a month to pay off credit card

221
00:11:49,298 --> 00:11:55,899
debt and your mortgage<font color="#CCCCCC"> Oh your wife</font>

222
00:11:51,519 --> 00:11:59,828
spreading the words told me this and I

223
00:11:55,899 --> 00:12:01,418
was<font color="#E5E5E5"> like oh thanks jacoub like goddamn</font>

224
00:11:59,828 --> 00:12:04,058
force that does make<font color="#CCCCCC"> sense him to be</font>

225
00:12:01,418 --> 00:12:07,269
<font color="#E5E5E5">grabbed great but because i was able to</font>

226
00:12:04,058 --> 00:12:10,899
let go the<font color="#E5E5E5"> jockey to try to grab the</font>

227
00:12:07,269 --> 00:12:14,970
<font color="#E5E5E5">reins and the horse intuitively guiding</font>

228
00:12:10,899 --> 00:12:18,938
the situation and said yes let's do this

229
00:12:14,970 --> 00:12:21,908
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay 2000 hours a month fucking couple</font>

230
00:12:18,938 --> 00:12:24,158
2000 hours month i couldnt and a<font color="#E5E5E5"> visit</font>

232
00:12:24,158 --> 00:12:34,229
anything before the horse<font color="#CCCCCC"> Satan did</font>

233
00:12:29,798 --> 00:12:34,228
everybody get this or might like smoke

234
00:12:34,960 --> 00:12:46,660
the point is<font color="#CCCCCC"> that you gotta find a way</font>

235
00:12:39,110 --> 00:12:50,960
to trust the horse<font color="#CCCCCC"> yeah no beast in you</font>

236
00:12:46,659 --> 00:12:54,199
silly make a describer let me go with

237
00:12:50,960 --> 00:12:57,040
the reins and it's scary because you've

238
00:12:54,200 --> 00:12:59,320
<font color="#CCCCCC">been holding on to the Ranger so long</font>

239
00:12:57,039 --> 00:13:03,139
but you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> doing a lot of right things</font>

240
00:12:59,320 --> 00:13:07,610
you've got your<font color="#E5E5E5"> clearly creative and</font>

241
00:13:03,139 --> 00:13:09,319
intuitive but get comfortable let me go

242
00:13:07,610 --> 00:13:13,120
<font color="#CCCCCC">and the only way</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I couldn't let go with</font>

243
00:13:09,320 --> 00:13:16,790
the meditation not selling anything

244
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:19,009
monitor<font color="#CCCCCC"> Philly the whole thing I just an</font>

245
00:13:16,789 --> 00:13:22,149
idea to be completely their artists it's

246
00:13:19,009 --> 00:13:26,840
what got me to relax let the board scary

247
00:13:22,149 --> 00:13:31,480
situation and now my animal care exactly

248
00:13:26,840 --> 00:13:33,920
<font color="#CCCCCC">that's why I'm so</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> weird in a lot of ways</font>

249
00:13:31,480 --> 00:13:36,080
of course tell what it always wants to

250
00:13:33,919 --> 00:13:37,610
do you know every once<font color="#E5E5E5"> in a while I have</font>

251
00:13:36,080 --> 00:13:40,120
<font color="#CCCCCC">to like pull back the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> horse of</font>

252
00:13:37,610 --> 00:13:40,120
embarrassing

253
00:13:47,139 --> 00:13:53,029
but more plus actually that's where i'm

254
00:13:49,789 --> 00:13:55,789
at right now is and I can empathize I

255
00:13:53,029 --> 00:13:57,980
know what it's like trying to get things

256
00:13:55,789 --> 00:14:00,949
to happen and thinking that you got

257
00:13:57,980 --> 00:14:03,080
stable horse<font color="#E5E5E5"> got even and got tighten up</font>

266
00:14:23,570 --> 00:14:30,040
the other day yeah where Christ says be

267
00:14:26,360 --> 00:14:32,450
like the birds of the field who are fed

268
00:14:30,039 --> 00:14:35,689
regardless of what they do you want you

269
00:14:32,450 --> 00:14:38,360
think I feed you and be<font color="#CCCCCC"> like the lilies</font>

270
00:14:35,690 --> 00:14:40,640
we've never toured over spit but yet I

271
00:14:38,360 --> 00:14:44,120
feed them with the Rays of the lights

272
00:14:40,639 --> 00:14:46,819
and so poetic stuff I'm told Jesus stuff

273
00:14:44,120 --> 00:14:51,230
but it's like white shit I've

274
00:14:46,820 --> 00:14:54,470

that life pulp fiction this is my

278
00:14:59,450 --> 00:15:07,930
<font color="#E5E5E5">experience my experience is what Jesus</font>

279
00:15:01,639 --> 00:15:07,929
said that birds

280
00:15:08,460 --> 00:15:11,600
flowers work

281
00:15:12,328 --> 00:15:21,958
easier said than done breathing deep

282
00:15:18,739 --> 00:15:25,999
dancing like a maniac<font color="#CCCCCC"> crazy has such a</font>

283
00:15:21,958 --> 00:15:28,979
visit meditating being free is

284
00:15:25,999 --> 00:15:33,360
essentially metaphorically letting go of
