1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:11,009
yo Elliot hey whats up guys today we got

2
00:00:09,388 --> 00:00:14,339
<font color="#E5E5E5">a question from our strength camp online</font>

3
00:00:11,009 --> 00:00:16,259
member vincent de<font color="#CCCCCC"> santiago Vincent's</font>

4
00:00:14,339 --> 00:00:19,170
problem is he can't keep a fucking job

5
00:00:16,260 --> 00:00:21,779
he says every new job that he gets about

6
00:00:19,170 --> 00:00:24,118
nine months in he starts getting bored

7
00:00:21,778 --> 00:00:25,980
and he just wants to quit there have

8
00:00:24,118 --> 00:00:28,079
even been circumstances by which he's

9
00:00:25,980 --> 00:00:31,170
gotten pay raises and he's like more

10
00:00:28,079 --> 00:00:34,439
money I don't care and he<font color="#CCCCCC"> just wants to</font>

11
00:00:31,170 --> 00:00:36,899
quit so he his question basically is

12
00:00:34,439 --> 00:00:39,659
Elliot although i love my industry i

13
00:00:36,899 --> 00:00:42,539
love the work that<font color="#E5E5E5"> i do i can't seem to</font>

14
00:00:39,659 --> 00:00:48,569
get past this board feeling after nine

15
00:00:42,539 --> 00:00:50,250
months so one approach this from a

16
00:00:48,570 --> 00:00:51,719
slightly different perspective you know

17
00:00:50,250 --> 00:00:54,119
because in the past I've said things

18
00:00:51,719 --> 00:00:56,969
like motivation and love gets you going

19
00:00:54,119 --> 00:00:58,769
but commitment keeps it rolling right

20
00:00:56,969 --> 00:01:01,260
and that would make<font color="#CCCCCC"> sense if you made a</font>

21
00:00:58,770 --> 00:01:03,210
particular commitment to a<font color="#E5E5E5"> mission or a</font>

22
00:01:01,259 --> 00:01:06,810
greater purpose but when you've got<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

23
00:01:03,210 --> 00:01:09,239
job<font color="#CCCCCC"> oftentimes</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it's like you just</font>

24
00:01:06,810 --> 00:01:11,460
<font color="#E5E5E5">getting a paycheck right i mean how many</font>

25
00:01:09,239 --> 00:01:12,569
of you guys out there<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> get a job and</font>

26
00:01:11,459 --> 00:01:14,069
the first thing you're<font color="#CCCCCC"> looking at is how</font>

27
00:01:12,569 --> 00:01:16,469
much you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> gonna make when you get</font>

28
00:01:14,069 --> 00:01:18,750
vacation how many<font color="#E5E5E5"> hours you got to work</font>

29
00:01:16,469 --> 00:01:21,719
it's all about the mechanics of the

30
00:01:18,750 --> 00:01:23,569
circumstance well recently I watched the

31
00:01:21,719 --> 00:01:27,179
video not recently it's an old video

32
00:01:23,569 --> 00:01:29,039
that was it brought it spoke about a

33
00:01:27,180 --> 00:01:31,439
study that<font color="#CCCCCC"> was done by the Federal</font>

34
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:33,600
Reserve Bank you know where all the

35
00:01:31,438 --> 00:01:35,789
money comes from and they want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> know</font>

36
00:01:33,599 --> 00:01:38,399
what made people motivated enough to

37
00:01:35,790 --> 00:01:40,829
work more work harder<font color="#CCCCCC"> or to get jobs and</font>

38
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:43,350
they did this<font color="#E5E5E5"> study and they found out</font>

39
00:01:40,828 --> 00:01:46,859
<font color="#E5E5E5">that people really weren't motivated by</font>

40
00:01:43,349 --> 00:01:49,649
more money they also offered people<font color="#E5E5E5"> more</font>

41
00:01:46,859 --> 00:01:51,500
vacation time interestingly enough I saw

42
00:01:49,649 --> 00:01:53,759
commercial the other day I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think where</font>

43
00:01:51,500 --> 00:01:55,530
most people don't use their paid

44
00:01:53,759 --> 00:01:56,728
vacation time in other words like at the

45
00:01:55,530 --> 00:01:59,340
end<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the year</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> when you've got</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> like</font>

46
00:01:56,728 --> 00:02:01,078
you've got 14 days<font color="#E5E5E5"> a vacation you could</font>

47
00:01:59,340 --> 00:02:03,750
use and do whatever the fuck you want

48
00:02:01,078 --> 00:02:05,339
with most people a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> people don't</font>

49
00:02:03,750 --> 00:02:07,349
do anything they just don't go on

50
00:02:05,340 --> 00:02:09,240
vacation so apparently<font color="#CCCCCC"> that doesn't</font>

51
00:02:07,349 --> 00:02:11,239
motivate people you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> time off</font>

52
00:02:09,240 --> 00:02:14,370
imagine might be something<font color="#E5E5E5"> that is</font>

53
00:02:11,240 --> 00:02:15,870
alluring to a particular profession or

54
00:02:14,370 --> 00:02:18,719
or career but I you know apparently

55
00:02:15,870 --> 00:02:20,069
people they<font color="#CCCCCC"> just don't give crap they</font>

56
00:02:18,719 --> 00:02:22,889
don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> want more money they don't more</font>

57
00:02:20,069 --> 00:02:27,269
time off but<font color="#E5E5E5"> what they do want is a</font>

58
00:02:22,889 --> 00:02:28,709
sense of purpose I want a mission people

59
00:02:27,270 --> 00:02:31,920
want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to feel like the work they're doing</font>

60
00:02:28,710 --> 00:02:34,650
mean something more than the mechanics

61
00:02:31,919 --> 00:02:38,759
of time on time off in dollars and I

62
00:02:34,650 --> 00:02:40,920
totally<font color="#E5E5E5"> get it so when you sign up for</font>

63
00:02:38,759 --> 00:02:43,109
<font color="#CCCCCC">these jobs and you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> enjoy the type of</font>

64
00:02:40,919 --> 00:02:46,619
work<font color="#E5E5E5"> you do you should</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> always you should</font>

65
00:02:43,110 --> 00:02:50,070
<font color="#E5E5E5">also find out what the company mission</font>

66
00:02:46,620 --> 00:02:52,349
is I<font color="#E5E5E5"> guarantee you that behind that door</font>

67
00:02:50,069 --> 00:02:55,349
behind that particular job that you're

68
00:02:52,349 --> 00:02:58,680
going to day in and day out there is a

69
00:02:55,349 --> 00:03:00,750
single<font color="#E5E5E5"> man who started that corporation</font>

70
00:02:58,680 --> 00:03:03,569
or woman and started that corporation

71
00:03:00,750 --> 00:03:06,810
and that<font color="#E5E5E5"> person probably had a vision a</font>

72
00:03:03,569 --> 00:03:09,060
mission a worldwide vision that's what

73
00:03:06,810 --> 00:03:11,280
entrepreneurs do we've got great big

74
00:03:09,060 --> 00:03:13,770
ideas about how we can affect<font color="#E5E5E5"> the world</font>

75
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:15,750
and I guarantee you that that person is

76
00:03:13,770 --> 00:03:18,240
infectious enough that if you get next

77
00:03:15,750 --> 00:03:20,939
to them they will infect you with that

78
00:03:18,240 --> 00:03:22,980
sense<font color="#E5E5E5"> of mission now when you get into a</font>

79
00:03:20,939 --> 00:03:24,719
job you get into a brand new company

80
00:03:22,979 --> 00:03:26,969
chances are you know you're kind of<font color="#E5E5E5"> low</font>

81
00:03:24,719 --> 00:03:30,210
on the totem pole you might not be going

82
00:03:26,969 --> 00:03:32,370
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> the quarterly and annual meetings you</font>

83
00:03:30,210 --> 00:03:33,780
might<font color="#E5E5E5"> not be rubbing elbows with the the</font>

84
00:03:32,370 --> 00:03:35,039
people at the<font color="#E5E5E5"> top</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> or the people</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> who are</font>

you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> really pulling the strings of</font>

86
00:03:35,039 --> 00:03:39,419
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> corporation but I would invite you</font>

87
00:03:37,110 --> 00:03:41,100
you know this would really be a step in

88
00:03:39,419 --> 00:03:42,929
the right direction not only for your

89
00:03:41,099 --> 00:03:44,699
own self esteem your own sense of

90
00:03:42,930 --> 00:03:46,920
purpose but also for the mission<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the</font>

91
00:03:44,699 --> 00:03:49,259
company that<font color="#CCCCCC"> you're working</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> for to ask</font>

92
00:03:46,919 --> 00:03:52,379
if you can go to the quarterly meeting

93
00:03:49,259 --> 00:03:55,889
<font color="#E5E5E5">ask if you could talk to the owner right</font>

94
00:03:52,379 --> 00:03:58,109
the CEO I'd like<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> meet this man I want</font>

95
00:03:55,889 --> 00:03:59,939
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> know what he what really drives and</font>

96
00:03:58,110 --> 00:04:03,270
motivates that man why did you<font color="#E5E5E5"> start</font>

97
00:03:59,939 --> 00:04:05,609
this company and if he is a righteous

98
00:04:03,270 --> 00:04:07,980
dude which hopefully he is you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

99
00:04:05,610 --> 00:04:10,470
think more and more<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the the new</font>

100
00:04:07,979 --> 00:04:13,949
startup companies that were seeing in

101
00:04:10,469 --> 00:04:16,680
this next generation<font color="#CCCCCC"> of business</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and an</font>

102
00:04:13,949 --> 00:04:19,199
economy are headed by really passionate

103
00:04:16,680 --> 00:04:21,600
people who have world transforming

104
00:04:19,199 --> 00:04:23,189
missions and visions and

105
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:24,740
you get next to that guy you just say

106
00:04:23,189 --> 00:04:27,389
look bit I just want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to take you out for</font>

107
00:04:24,740 --> 00:04:29,579
for dinner you know I want to do

108
00:04:27,389 --> 00:04:32,789
something<font color="#CCCCCC"> nice for you and sit with</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> them</font>

109
00:04:29,579 --> 00:04:35,750
you will probably get infected with the

110
00:04:32,790 --> 00:04:38,250
passion that sparked the entire

111
00:04:35,750 --> 00:04:39,720
organization that you're a part of now

112
00:04:38,250 --> 00:04:41,339
if you go on<font color="#E5E5E5"> this meeting</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and the guy is</font>

113
00:04:39,720 --> 00:04:44,340
a complete douchebag he cares about

114
00:04:41,339 --> 00:04:47,429
nothing but the bottom line and you know

115
00:04:44,339 --> 00:04:48,750
people using too much toilet paper well

116
00:04:47,430 --> 00:04:51,840
then you know you're probably in the

117
00:04:48,750 --> 00:04:57,569
wrong company you know so when you're

118
00:04:51,839 --> 00:05:00,329
looking for<font color="#CCCCCC"> a job</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> even look for a place</font>

119
00:04:57,569 --> 00:05:04,589
that's headed by people and run in such

120
00:05:00,329 --> 00:05:08,849
a way that mission and vision is the

121
00:05:04,589 --> 00:05:13,139
biggest driver not finance you need

122
00:05:08,850 --> 00:05:15,360
money sure as<font color="#CCCCCC"> hell do super important</font>

123
00:05:13,139 --> 00:05:17,250
should be looked at can't have a company

124
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:19,830
without money nothing happens without a

125
00:05:17,250 --> 00:05:21,779
sale but if you want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be infused with</font>

126
00:05:19,829 --> 00:05:24,649
<font color="#E5E5E5">the passion and the fire to keep going</font>

127
00:05:21,779 --> 00:05:26,389
get on that mission train brother done
