creating this video today the content of

13
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:30,199
the video is that our friend is in love

14
00:00:28,199 --> 00:00:35,489
with a girl<font color="#E5E5E5"> they're 22 years old and</font>

relationship for whatever reason even

18
00:00:40,920 --> 00:00:45,390
though our friend wants to propose or

19
00:00:42,869 --> 00:00:48,058
perhaps has already a pope or<font color="#CCCCCC"> propose to</font>

00:00:45,390 --> 00:00:50,878
this woman the father has created a

21
00:00:48,058 --> 00:00:52,229
situation where he cannot wear our

22
00:00:50,878 --> 00:00:55,349
friend cannot get in touch with this

23
00:00:52,229 --> 00:00:57,390
girl he's distraught he's wondering how

24
00:00:55,350 --> 00:00:59,399
can he appeal to the father how can<font color="#CCCCCC"> he</font>

25
00:00:57,390 --> 00:01:04,890
get through and create a situation where

26
00:00:59,399 --> 00:01:08,579
he can<font color="#CCCCCC"> be with his beloved and the way i</font>

00:01:08,579 --> 00:01:13,650
the depths of my soul from my core from

29
00:01:11,159 --> 00:01:17,609
my heart is to see<font color="#CCCCCC"> you work on</font>

30
00:01:13,650 --> 00:01:19,560
befriending the father<font color="#CCCCCC"> i know</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that if</font>

31
00:01:17,609 --> 00:01:22,228
there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to be a young boy that I</font>

32
00:01:19,560 --> 00:01:25,740
approve of in dating one of my daughters

33
00:01:22,228 --> 00:01:28,950
it will be a boy that I have a

34
00:01:25,739 --> 00:01:30,449
connection point with so often I'll joke

35
00:01:28,950 --> 00:01:31,710
even<font color="#CCCCCC"> though my children are very young</font>

36
00:01:30,450 --> 00:01:33,509
right now I'll joke and I'll say that

37
00:01:31,709 --> 00:01:35,908
<font color="#E5E5E5">the boy that comes in dates my daughter</font>

38
00:01:33,509 --> 00:01:38,209
had better be<font color="#CCCCCC"> able</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to deadlift or at</font>

39
00:01:35,909 --> 00:01:40,049
least attempt lifting a stone at my gym

40
00:01:38,209 --> 00:01:43,319
doesn't mean that he has to be athletic

41
00:01:40,049 --> 00:01:47,820
<font color="#E5E5E5">or gonna be a big beastly brute like I</font>

42
00:01:43,319 --> 00:01:52,258
am but I have to either try to find or

43
00:01:47,819 --> 00:01:56,669
we naturally have created a connection

44
00:01:52,259 --> 00:01:59,579
point and what you need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to find with</font>

45
00:01:56,670 --> 00:02:01,680
this father if he doesn't hate you just

46
00:01:59,578 --> 00:02:04,319
yet that might be the case but you

47
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:06,719
always can redeem yourself is a

48
00:02:04,319 --> 00:02:10,318
connection point so instead of looking

49
00:02:06,718 --> 00:02:12,120
at what you want look at the obstacle

50
00:02:10,318 --> 00:02:13,979
and how you can get through it

51
00:02:12,120 --> 00:02:17,879
but don't see the obstacle as an evil

52
00:02:13,979 --> 00:02:23,219
see it as something that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can use to</font>

53
00:02:17,878 --> 00:02:26,039
<font color="#E5E5E5">work on your ability of coercion you</font>

54
00:02:23,219 --> 00:02:28,709
know I use that term loosely because

55
00:02:26,039 --> 00:02:31,739
it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not meant to manipulate but it's</font>

56
00:02:28,709 --> 00:02:34,860
meant to figure out how to soften your

57
00:02:31,739 --> 00:02:39,840
approach and allow someone to receive

58
00:02:34,860 --> 00:02:42,209

89
00:03:58,500 --> 00:04:02,759
quickly he might open up instantly and

90
00:04:00,598 --> 00:04:05,759
say you know what I resisted you because

91
00:04:02,759 --> 00:04:07,679
I didn't know<font color="#CCCCCC"> you but you went out of</font>

your way and you are now approaching me

firmly on not you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> not on your terms</font>

95

97
00:04:20,038 --> 00:04:24,658
very easily<font color="#E5E5E5"> and quickly open up</font>

101
00:04:30,949 --> 00:04:34,770
I'm banking on the fact that you're

102
00:04:32,908 --> 00:04:38,959
probably an okay guy your<font color="#CCCCCC"> douchebag</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font>

104
00:04:38,959 --> 00:04:44,810
again in a very businesslike and

105
00:04:41,668 --> 00:04:48,658
grounded fashion not ahead in the sky

106
00:04:44,810 --> 00:04:51,930
excited and in love but very pragmatic

107
00:04:48,658 --> 00:04:55,038
practical grounded and businesslike you

108
00:04:51,930 --> 00:05:01,168
approach the topic of his daughter and

109
00:04:55,038 --> 00:05:03,389
you speak in terms of concreteness not

110
00:05:01,168 --> 00:05:04,889
love not poetry you don't want to appeal

111
00:05:03,389 --> 00:05:06,750
to his poetry right now it<font color="#CCCCCC"> doesn't sound</font>

112
00:05:04,889 --> 00:05:10,530
<font color="#E5E5E5">like he's a very poetic man to begin</font>

don't talk<font color="#CCCCCC"> about how you feel he's</font>

115
00:05:12,959 --> 00:05:16,019
probably not interested<font color="#E5E5E5"> in how you feel</font>

116
00:05:14,490 --> 00:05:19,019
it's probably<font color="#CCCCCC"> more interested in your</font>

117
00:05:16,019 --> 00:05:22,228
intention this is my intention with your
