00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,270
hey what's<font color="#E5E5E5"> up guys this morning I wrote</font>

2
00:00:01,860 --> 00:00:05,639
an article that you could read down

3
00:00:03,270 --> 00:00:08,638
below<font color="#E5E5E5"> about building</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the foundations for</font>

4
00:00:05,639 --> 00:00:09,989
physical strength you'll also find a

00:00:08,638 --> 00:00:12,539
link to my advanced<font color="#CCCCCC"> five by five</font>

6
00:00:09,990 --> 00:00:15,000
strength training routine down below but

7
00:00:12,539 --> 00:00:18,989
today in this video what I wanted<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

8
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:21,028
talk<font color="#CCCCCC"> about our how the foundation</font>

9
00:00:18,989 --> 00:00:23,579
principles related to building physical

10
00:00:21,028 --> 00:00:24,899
strength also relate to becoming a

11
00:00:23,579 --> 00:00:27,659
stronger version of yourself in

12
00:00:24,899 --> 00:00:30,509
absolutely all realms of life now if you

13
00:00:27,660 --> 00:00:33,600
watch enough of my videos it's very

14
00:00:30,510 --> 00:00:36,539
clear<font color="#CCCCCC"> to you that I am</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of the opinion of</font>

15
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:39,239
the belief of the conviction if you will

16
00:00:36,539 --> 00:00:40,890
that the body is the<font color="#CCCCCC"> mind and the way</font>

17
00:00:39,238 --> 00:00:43,349
you care for<font color="#E5E5E5"> your body the way you carry</font>

18
00:00:40,890 --> 00:00:45,780
your body the way your body is presented

19
00:00:43,350 --> 00:00:48,989
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> the world is a great reflection of</font>

20
00:00:45,780 --> 00:00:52,649
your internal character your psychology

21
00:00:48,988 --> 00:00:55,198
and if that is the case then<font color="#CCCCCC"> the way we</font>

22
00:00:52,649 --> 00:00:58,049
build our bodies carry our body

23
00:00:55,198 --> 00:01:02,689
strengthen our bodies detoxify our

24
00:00:58,049 --> 00:01:06,899
bodies use our bodies all<font color="#E5E5E5"> are</font>

25
00:01:02,689 --> 00:01:09,829
reflections<font color="#E5E5E5"> of and add to and I'm</font>

26
00:01:06,900 --> 00:01:12,840
correct that are commensurate with our

27
00:01:09,829 --> 00:01:15,629
psychological character and mental

28
00:01:12,840 --> 00:01:18,270
strength it's one thing body and mind

29
00:01:15,629 --> 00:01:23,039
one thing so when I use language like

30
00:01:18,269 --> 00:01:25,048
core mechanics work capacity as<font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font>

31
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:27,150
relates<font color="#CCCCCC"> to strength training understand</font>

32
00:01:25,049 --> 00:01:29,310
that when those things are present in

33
00:01:27,150 --> 00:01:31,350
you whether or<font color="#E5E5E5"> not you're a football</font>

34
00:01:29,310 --> 00:01:34,829
player<font color="#E5E5E5"> or a strong man sure a strong</font>

professional strawman or power lifter it

36
00:01:34,828 --> 00:01:41,089
still applies because you want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to have</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

37
00:01:37,590 --> 00:01:44,909
solid strong physical foundation to

38

carry your soul to work in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> world</font>

39
00:01:44,909 --> 00:01:49,590
with you understand so we have to honor

40
00:01:47,909 --> 00:01:52,740
it you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> there's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> some</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> people that are</font>

41
00:01:49,590 --> 00:01:55,920
so spiritually minded that they're

42
00:01:52,739 --> 00:01:57,239
physically useless right and that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not</font>

00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:58,829
<font color="#CCCCCC">the case that's not what we want right</font>

44
00:01:57,239 --> 00:02:02,129
we want to be physically<font color="#CCCCCC"> strong mentally</font>

45
00:01:58,828 --> 00:02:04,468
strong we want every every facet of<font color="#E5E5E5"> our</font>

47
00:02:04,468 --> 00:02:07,549
that we do in<font color="#E5E5E5"> would be gauging so today</font>

48
00:02:06,328 --> 00:02:11,939
<font color="#E5E5E5">I'm going to talk about the three</font>

49
00:02:07,549 --> 00:02:13,259
foundation principles for success i'm

50
00:02:11,939 --> 00:02:13,710
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to use language as it relates to</font>

51
00:02:13,259 --> 00:02:16,469
<font color="#E5E5E5">strength</font>

52
00:02:13,710 --> 00:02:18,840
training because we're all on<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

53
00:02:16,469 --> 00:02:21,560
journey of<font color="#E5E5E5"> becoming stronger versions of</font>

54
00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:26,599
ourselves very first foundation

55
00:02:21,560 --> 00:02:29,490
principle for success is core strength

56
00:02:26,599 --> 00:02:32,460
now this term is thrown around quite a

57
00:02:29,490 --> 00:02:35,100
bit and a lot of<font color="#CCCCCC"> people</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> have a lot</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

58
00:02:32,460 --> 00:02:36,990
associations and confusion in fact about

59
00:02:35,099 --> 00:02:38,699
what poor strength actually means<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

60
00:02:36,990 --> 00:02:42,390
think<font color="#E5E5E5"> paul chek does the best way of</font>

61
00:02:38,699 --> 00:02:44,729
describing the core by saying it is

62
00:02:42,389 --> 00:02:47,669
everything from the tip of<font color="#E5E5E5"> your head to</font>

63
00:02:44,729 --> 00:02:50,280
your perineum right right down<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

64
00:02:47,669 --> 00:02:52,139
between your balls in your butthole top

65
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:55,020
of the top of the head to<font color="#CCCCCC"> the bottom of</font>

66
00:02:52,139 --> 00:02:57,479
the spine if you look at<font color="#CCCCCC"> a if you look</font>

67
00:02:55,020 --> 00:03:00,719
at a skeleton of a human being

68
00:02:57,479 --> 00:03:02,639
essentially it's the skull the spine and

69
00:03:00,719 --> 00:03:05,250
<font color="#E5E5E5">the pelvis everything else is</font>

70
00:03:02,639 --> 00:03:07,349
extremities the arms the legs<font color="#E5E5E5"> are</font>

71
00:03:05,250 --> 00:03:12,330
<font color="#E5E5E5">extremities but the head the neck the</font>

72
00:03:07,349 --> 00:03:14,699
torso the lumbar<font color="#CCCCCC"> spine the sacrum and</font>

73
00:03:12,330 --> 00:03:17,670
the pelvis<font color="#E5E5E5"> all of that tied together</font>

74
00:03:14,699 --> 00:03:19,859
equals the core now what's interesting

75
00:03:17,669 --> 00:03:23,849
about the court important about the core

76
00:03:19,860 --> 00:03:27,330
is that the core houses and protects

77
00:03:23,849 --> 00:03:30,539
<font color="#E5E5E5">your organs so your brain is protected</font>

78
00:03:27,330 --> 00:03:33,000
by your skull your spinal cord is

79
00:03:30,539 --> 00:03:37,759
protected by the vertebrae each

80
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:40,830
<font color="#E5E5E5">vertebrae has a protective as well as a</font>

81
00:03:37,759 --> 00:03:43,739
agility and movement capacity associated

82
00:03:40,830 --> 00:03:45,810
with it right so your spine<font color="#E5E5E5"> and then</font>

83
00:03:43,740 --> 00:03:47,340
down in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the pelvic floor if you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> look at</font>

84
00:03:45,810 --> 00:03:49,620
<font color="#E5E5E5">the pedal of the pelvis like a bone</font>

85
00:03:47,340 --> 00:03:53,280
right turn it<font color="#E5E5E5"> up like this it's sort of</font>

86
00:03:49,620 --> 00:03:56,129
<font color="#E5E5E5">like a basin it's a bowl because it</font>

87
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:59,789
houses your internal organs all of which

88
00:03:56,129 --> 00:04:02,280
include the digestive organs the sexual

89
00:03:59,789 --> 00:04:04,169
organs down there and<font color="#CCCCCC"> then stacked up</font>

90
00:04:02,280 --> 00:04:05,969
right up into your rib cage right

91
00:04:04,169 --> 00:04:07,589
because you can continue<font color="#E5E5E5"> can consider</font>

92
00:04:05,969 --> 00:04:10,259
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> rib cage a part of that whole</font>

93
00:04:07,590 --> 00:04:12,090
mechanism as well you've got the heart

94
00:04:10,259 --> 00:04:14,789
you got your stomach and you've got your

95
00:04:12,090 --> 00:04:17,639
lungs all housed in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> ribcage you got</font>

96
00:04:14,789 --> 00:04:20,009
a head the ribcage and the pelvis which

97
00:04:17,639 --> 00:04:23,909
<font color="#E5E5E5">comprise the core now the muscles on a</font>

superficial that<font color="#E5E5E5"> wrap around that are</font>

99
00:04:23,910 --> 00:04:29,199
associated with

100
00:04:25,839 --> 00:04:31,569
the core are there for a<font color="#E5E5E5"> number of</font>

101
00:04:29,199 --> 00:04:33,340
reasons number one again<font color="#CCCCCC"> is to protect</font>

102
00:04:31,569 --> 00:04:35,589
right like your rectus abdominis for

103
00:04:33,339 --> 00:04:38,019
example is<font color="#CCCCCC"> the big bulky muscles on the</font>

00:04:35,589 --> 00:04:40,329
<font color="#E5E5E5">top</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of your abdominals the ones that</font>

105
00:04:38,019 --> 00:04:42,909
give you the six-pack look those muscles

106
00:04:40,329 --> 00:04:46,198
have a protective<font color="#CCCCCC"> mechanism protective</font>

107
00:04:42,910 --> 00:04:50,290
role that's what if you will in the

108
00:04:46,199 --> 00:04:51,939
mechanics of that of the core if you get

109
00:04:50,290 --> 00:04:53,770
punched in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> stomach back then that's</font>

110
00:04:51,939 --> 00:04:55,600
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> muscle that tenses up and tightens</font>

111
00:04:53,769 --> 00:04:59,259
so that a boxer won't get his liver

112
00:04:55,600 --> 00:05:02,350
blown apart when somebody punches him it

113
00:04:59,259 --> 00:05:03,579
also<font color="#E5E5E5"> helps</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to prevent hinging right if</font>

114
00:05:02,350 --> 00:05:06,580
you're playing football and you go up

also have<font color="#CCCCCC"> the necessity for movement and</font>

pumping muscles that are associated with

00:05:29,168 --> 00:05:37,959
pumping would include your the solar

you're the stomach muscles are in a way

129

version yourself in building up physical

161
00:07:14,839 --> 00:07:19,159
strength biomechanics is of concern

162
00:07:17,180 --> 00:07:21,620
because it all has to do with your

163
00:07:19,160 --> 00:07:23,480
<font color="#CCCCCC">movement your ability to move and every</font>

164
00:07:21,620 --> 00:07:26,750
movement emanates from a position of

165
00:07:23,480 --> 00:07:29,210
rest so biomechanics is also associated

166
00:07:26,750 --> 00:07:31,430
with your posture right so you're going

167
00:07:29,209 --> 00:07:34,250
to have certain muscles in the core in
