00:00:02,759 --> 00:00:07,649
leadership he goes on to<font color="#CCCCCC"> say that uh he</font>

3
00:00:05,309 --> 00:00:10,829
works for Boeing and it's a private

4
00:00:07,649 --> 00:00:12,330
sector job and and he wants<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be a good</font>

5
00:00:10,830 --> 00:00:15,210
<font color="#CCCCCC">leader he</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> just doesn't know exactly</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> how</font>

6
00:00:12,330 --> 00:00:17,670
he spent six years in the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Marine corpse</font>

7
00:00:15,210 --> 00:00:20,250

00:00:17,670 --> 00:00:22,260
did really<font color="#E5E5E5"> well in the military but now</font>

9
00:00:20,250 --> 00:00:25,198
that he is in civilian life style

10
00:00:22,260 --> 00:00:26,699
working in a private sector job he's

11
00:00:25,199 --> 00:00:28,618
wondering how do I go about being a

12
00:00:26,699 --> 00:00:30,390
leader because I can tell you and you

13
00:00:28,618 --> 00:00:33,179

14
00:00:30,390 --> 00:00:35,700
very different<font color="#E5E5E5"> then than being in the</font>

15
00:00:33,179 --> 00:00:38,100
private sector or being<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the civilian</font>

16
00:00:35,700 --> 00:00:40,770
world in the military<font color="#E5E5E5"> you are praised</font>

17
00:00:38,100 --> 00:00:43,410
for your ability<font color="#CCCCCC"> to follow directions</font>

21
00:00:48,359 --> 00:00:51,689
I was in the military but that was the

22
00:00:50,128 --> 00:00:53,698
mindset that I had when I played sports

23
00:00:51,689 --> 00:00:55,948
was you I<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't have as long as I don't</font>

24
00:00:53,698 --> 00:00:58,320
have to<font color="#CCCCCC"> think</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you tell me what to do I'm</font>

25
00:00:55,948 --> 00:01:00,718
gonna crush it right a lot of men a lot

26
00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:02,280

it that's how<font color="#CCCCCC"> it was in the military I</font>

29
00:01:04,109 --> 00:01:09,299
assume but what you're experiencing now

30
00:01:07,739 --> 00:01:11,429
in the private sector world and amongst

31
00:01:09,299 --> 00:01:17,939
peers that are not familiar with that

32
00:01:11,430 --> 00:01:19,590
mindset is that creativity and this is a

33
00:01:17,938 --> 00:01:21,508
<font color="#E5E5E5">secret right this is something</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that not</font>

41
00:01:37,560 --> 00:01:45,090
to you as a leader better than being a

42
00:01:40,739 --> 00:01:47,789
drill sergeant or a good private right

43
00:01:45,090 --> 00:01:50,159
someone who shouts and barks orders or

44
00:01:47,790 --> 00:01:51,509
someone who follows orders and what I

45
00:01:50,159 --> 00:01:53,609
<font color="#E5E5E5">mean by this is that you've</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> got</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

the processes of your job or your art or

48
00:01:56,368 --> 00:02:00,569
your craft or whatever it<font color="#E5E5E5"> is that you're</font>

49
00:01:57,509 --> 00:02:04,049
doing and look for ways that you could

50
00:02:00,569 --> 00:02:06,629
step out and make the process better or

51
00:02:04,049 --> 00:02:08,849
go above and beyond but in a very

52
00:02:06,629 --> 00:02:13,430
creative way not necessarily work longer

53
00:02:08,848 --> 00:02:15,139
or harder but be innovative be creative

54
00:02:13,430 --> 00:02:17,239
