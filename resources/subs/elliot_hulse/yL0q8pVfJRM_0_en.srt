22
00:00:56,549 --> 00:01:02,878

creative connection economy that's

24
00:01:02,878 --> 00:01:08,310
associated with art like Seth Godin

00:01:05,728 --> 00:01:10,289
would call it and sharing communication

31
00:01:18,959 --> 00:01:24,298
valuable today right so the problem is

32
00:01:21,420 --> 00:01:26,460
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> the school systems are still</font>

33
00:01:24,299 --> 00:01:29,040
designed off the old industrial

revolution model you know where

35
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:35,009
everything is standardized will you be a

00:01:31,739 --> 00:01:36,449
<font color="#E5E5E5">good cop crisis and and they really</font>

37
00:01:35,009 --> 00:01:41,129
reduce the creativity and the

38
00:01:36,450 --> 00:01:44,280
individuality and the godlike expression

39
00:01:41,129 --> 00:01:46,649
in every<font color="#E5E5E5"> human being by making</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a sit in</font>

00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:52,469
rows and follow directions and become

00:01:46,649 --> 00:01:54,299

42
00:01:52,469 --> 00:01:57,000
back<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> doing what you love like</font>

43
00:01:54,299 --> 00:02:00,240
following having that courage to follow

44
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:05,430
your heart really<font color="#E5E5E5"> and to not fall into</font>

45
00:02:00,239 --> 00:02:08,429
that trap I mean yeah it takes courage a

46
00:02:05,430 --> 00:02:11,969
part of what the<font color="#E5E5E5"> Industrial Revolution</font>

47
00:02:08,429 --> 00:02:13,318
and just the culture at large for many

48
00:02:11,969 --> 00:02:17,310
different reasons

49
00:02:13,318 --> 00:02:19,708
has done is it has alienated us from

50
00:02:17,310 --> 00:02:22,560
ourselves so you literally have to

51
00:02:19,709 --> 00:02:24,959
stifle the the heart and<font color="#E5E5E5"> the sexuality</font>

52
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:27,420
and a<font color="#E5E5E5"> human beings body in order to get</font>

53
00:02:24,959 --> 00:02:29,938
him to sit as like a Pavlov's dog and to

54
00:02:27,419 --> 00:02:31,138
respond to bells and whistles right<font color="#CCCCCC"> no</font>

55
00:02:29,938 --> 00:02:33,209
these bells go off when we<font color="#E5E5E5"> go to our</font>

56
00:02:31,139 --> 00:02:35,700
places you want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> say we're very easily</font>

57
00:02:33,209 --> 00:02:38,128
conditioned because we we've been we've

58
00:02:35,699 --> 00:02:40,048
been castrated from our bodies and we're

59
00:02:38,128 --> 00:02:42,748
way up in our heads so what ends up

60
00:02:40,049 --> 00:02:44,549
happening is first of all we're taught

61
00:02:42,748 --> 00:02:46,888
not to trust our hearts we're taught not

62
00:02:44,549 --> 00:02:49,079
to trust our sexuality so there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> your</font>

63
00:02:46,889 --> 00:02:50,340
battle against culture because culture

64
00:02:49,079 --> 00:02:52,230
wants you up in your<font color="#CCCCCC"> head</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> because you</font>

65
00:02:50,340 --> 00:02:54,180
<font color="#E5E5E5">could be you can I ring a bell in your</font>

66
00:02:52,229 --> 00:02:56,698
head you'll respond back you're far

67
00:02:54,180 --> 00:02:58,230
easier to respond to control someone by

68
00:02:56,699 --> 00:03:00,359
their head and someone at their balls

69
00:02:58,229 --> 00:03:03,060
yeah I<font color="#E5E5E5"> mean let's say that someone who's</font>

70
00:03:00,359 --> 00:03:05,340
moving from<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know deep rooted in</font>

71
00:03:03,060 --> 00:03:06,598
motion that's a wild hysterical

72
00:03:05,340 --> 00:03:09,959
character you don't want to fuck<font color="#CCCCCC"> with</font>

73
00:03:06,598 --> 00:03:11,098
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> guy because he's nuts right to you</font>

74
00:03:09,959 --> 00:03:13,680
know someone who's very easily

75
00:03:11,098 --> 00:03:16,168
manipulated yeah so there's a culture

76
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:20,209
that you're fighting<font color="#E5E5E5"> against but then</font>

77
00:03:16,169 --> 00:03:22,409
there's also you now have become

78
00:03:20,209 --> 00:03:24,389
schizoid you become schizophrenic

79
00:03:22,408 --> 00:03:26,938
because there's a part of you that

80
00:03:24,389 --> 00:03:29,009
<font color="#E5E5E5">really does exist and some brilliant</font>

81
00:03:26,938 --> 00:03:30,418
brilliant part of you it's the part of

82
00:03:29,008 --> 00:03:32,008
you that beats your heart without you

83
00:03:30,419 --> 00:03:33,840
having to think about it it's the part

84
00:03:32,008 --> 00:03:35,638
of a woman that grows a baby without her

85
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:37,938
having to do<font color="#CCCCCC"> it it's a part of you that</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">digest your food assimilates and</font>

87
00:03:37,938 --> 00:03:45,780
eliminates waste from your body it's the

88
00:03:40,650 --> 00:03:48,509
part of you that your intuition lies in

89
00:03:45,780 --> 00:03:51,658
your<font color="#E5E5E5"> everything it's all in</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> this part</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

every<font color="#CCCCCC"> all the brilliance that's within</font>

93
00:03:56,188 --> 00:04:02,608
them you ask them what do you want to do

94
00:03:58,938 --> 00:04:05,340
they have no clue and if the feelings do

95
00:04:02,609 --> 00:04:08,310
come<font color="#CCCCCC"> up in their body like yeah I really</font>

97
00:04:08,310 --> 00:04:14,000

98
00:04:10,169 --> 00:04:18,000
and fighting<font color="#CCCCCC"> the body there's this doubt</font>

99
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:20,370
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know everyone</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> tells me</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I can't do it</font>

100
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:23,728
<font color="#E5E5E5">it's weird it doesn't no one else has</font>

103
00:04:27,170 --> 00:04:34,100
so the invitation is to mr. it is in a

104
00:04:31,139 --> 00:04:37,139
way to reject<font color="#E5E5E5"> the conditioning society</font>

00:04:34,100 --> 00:04:40,350
we<font color="#E5E5E5"> gain the connection with your heart</font>

106
00:04:37,139 --> 00:04:42,029
and then learn to follow what does<font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font>

107

00:04:57,600 --> 00:05:02,670
energy which is if you study Freud he

114
00:04:59,910 --> 00:05:04,980
called it the libido and if you study

115
00:05:02,670 --> 00:05:07,470
like chi gong<font color="#E5E5E5"> Tai</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Chi they call this a</font>

produced in that area your sex hormones

124
00:05:26,040 --> 00:05:30,180
and your adrenal hormones<font color="#E5E5E5"> I mean they're</font>

125
00:05:27,449 --> 00:05:33,779
all centered around the hips the thing

126
00:05:30,180 --> 00:05:36,720
is that<font color="#E5E5E5"> to access that particular part</font>

127
00:05:33,779 --> 00:05:39,839
of you you've got<font color="#E5E5E5"> to have soft</font>

128
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:43,490
musculature so that you can breathe deep

ignites our physiology it not only

131
00:05:47,310 --> 00:05:51,959
brings oxygen in for your blood to

132
00:05:49,379 --> 00:05:53,430
transport but it also if you're soft

133
00:05:51,959 --> 00:05:55,469
enough and this is what i invite people

134
00:05:53,430 --> 00:05:58,019
to do through the things that<font color="#E5E5E5"> i teach if</font>

135
00:05:55,470 --> 00:06:00,360
you're soft enough your diaphragm drops

136
00:05:58,019 --> 00:06:02,669
down where it pushes your belly<font color="#E5E5E5"> and your</font>

137
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:05,850
organs out watch a baby breathe its

138
00:06:02,670 --> 00:06:09,600
belly does this and it stimulates it

139
00:06:05,850 --> 00:06:12,270
most literally massages<font color="#CCCCCC"> the everything</font>

140
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:15,570
from the pelvic floor up through your

141
00:06:12,269 --> 00:06:18,779
the entire abdominal cavity it literally

142
00:06:15,569 --> 00:06:22,170
it massages and stimulates the hormonal

143
00:06:18,779 --> 00:06:24,089
production it is similar ads to your

146
00:06:26,970 --> 00:06:31,860
went when the the ancients wrote the

story about creation they said<font color="#E5E5E5"> that the</font>

148
00:06:31,860 --> 00:06:38,750
<font color="#CCCCCC">god breathed into clay breathes into the</font>

149
00:06:36,360 --> 00:06:42,199
dirt we're literally breath

150
00:06:38,750 --> 00:06:44,810
and dirt and we've kind of created a

151
00:06:42,199 --> 00:06:47,529
situation where because<font color="#E5E5E5"> we're so much up</font>

152
00:06:44,810 --> 00:06:49,879
<font color="#E5E5E5">in our heads we create what I call</font>

153
00:06:47,529 --> 00:06:52,339
neurotic holding patterns and you know

154
00:06:49,879 --> 00:06:53,659
that these holding patterns are evident

155
00:06:52,339 --> 00:06:55,939
when you look at someone's body and

156
00:06:53,660 --> 00:06:58,400
their clenched<font color="#CCCCCC"> that are holding their</font>

157
00:06:55,939 --> 00:07:00,740
hands tight they're chewing their<font color="#CCCCCC"> faces</font>

158
00:06:58,399 --> 00:07:02,870
they gotten like nervous<font color="#CCCCCC"> tics there if</font>

159
00:07:00,740 --> 00:07:04,790
you notice if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you to take notice if</font>

160
00:07:02,870 --> 00:07:07,149
you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> holding your belly tights that</font>

161
00:07:04,790 --> 00:07:09,530
you don't breathe deep people who are

162
00:07:07,149 --> 00:07:12,469
figuratively but literally tight asses

163
00:07:09,529 --> 00:07:15,139
yeah are sucking their cheeks together

164
00:07:12,470 --> 00:07:16,730
and sucking their anus up just think

165
00:07:15,139 --> 00:07:17,959
about that area<font color="#E5E5E5"> again you're holding</font>

166
00:07:16,730 --> 00:07:21,410
your belly tight you're holding your ass

167
00:07:17,959 --> 00:07:23,989
up your entire pelvic floor is the

168
00:07:21,410 --> 00:07:26,450
energy is being cycled if you're always

169
00:07:23,990 --> 00:07:28,790
grinding your teeth right if you're

170
00:07:26,449 --> 00:07:31,639
always thinking and that's causing

171
00:07:28,790 --> 00:07:34,970
tension in your head in your face you

172
00:07:31,639 --> 00:07:37,668
cannot soften enough to allow full what

173
00:07:34,970 --> 00:07:39,470
will hum right call respiratory wave

174
00:07:37,668 --> 00:07:43,579
this is what it looks like when a baby

175
00:07:39,470 --> 00:07:45,380
breathes so wave yeah so what<font color="#E5E5E5"> I invite</font>

176
00:07:43,579 --> 00:07:47,930
<font color="#E5E5E5">you to do and I invite people to do</font>

177
00:07:45,379 --> 00:07:50,180
because<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm an exercise specialist and I</font>

178
00:07:47,930 --> 00:07:51,470
also seek to support<font color="#CCCCCC"> people in growing</font>

179
00:07:50,180 --> 00:07:53,720
stronger in all areas of their life

180
00:07:51,470 --> 00:07:54,950
which<font color="#CCCCCC"> means that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> your body again is a</font>

181
00:07:53,720 --> 00:07:58,310
physical manifestation of what's

182
00:07:54,949 --> 00:08:02,209
happening psychologically right to stop

183
00:07:58,310 --> 00:08:04,668
<font color="#CCCCCC">be</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so tense right and there are</font>

184
00:08:02,209 --> 00:08:07,879
exercises that help reduce<font color="#E5E5E5"> the tension</font>

185
00:08:04,668 --> 00:08:09,889
across the eyes across the jaw across

186
00:08:07,879 --> 00:08:12,199
the chest across the belly and the

187
00:08:09,889 --> 00:08:15,680
pelvic floor all<font color="#E5E5E5"> of which are extra</font>

188
00:08:12,199 --> 00:08:17,089
respiratory muscles so when you breathe

189
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:21,560
into your balls that literally means

190
00:08:17,089 --> 00:08:25,459
you're soft enough<font color="#CCCCCC"> to breathe deep yeah</font>

191
00:08:21,560 --> 00:08:30,470
and you've said actually a father son

192
00:08:25,459 --> 00:08:32,449
Holy Spirit yeah caught that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I love that</font>

193
00:08:30,470 --> 00:08:34,158
I never I guess would have thought of

194
00:08:32,450 --> 00:08:36,800
<font color="#CCCCCC">that because we need them we</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> need them</font>

195
00:08:34,158 --> 00:08:38,750
all of course but it's like do you see

196
00:08:36,799 --> 00:08:42,228
it as coming more from<font color="#CCCCCC"> that place of</font>

197
00:08:38,750 --> 00:08:44,809
spirit though first out to<font color="#CCCCCC"> the mind or</font>

198
00:08:42,229 --> 00:08:47,180
how would you relate that there needs to

199
00:08:44,809 --> 00:08:49,969
be a and<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's why</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we do father son</font>

200
00:08:47,179 --> 00:08:52,669
Holy Ghost that's why there is in all

201
00:08:49,970 --> 00:08:54,110
traditions there's this triad

202
00:08:52,669 --> 00:08:56,689
of understanding if you study like the

203
00:08:54,110 --> 00:08:58,750
Kahuna model in<font color="#E5E5E5"> Hawaii there's there's</font>

204
00:08:56,690 --> 00:09:01,430
the father the mother and the child

205
00:08:58,750 --> 00:09:03,200
right there's always there always seems

206
00:09:01,429 --> 00:09:04,879
to be this 3 i'm trying to think of

207
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:08,540
other examples but if you study

208
00:09:04,879 --> 00:09:10,129
physiology you recognize that physically

209
00:09:08,539 --> 00:09:12,319
within the brain there are three brains

210
00:09:10,129 --> 00:09:15,860
we literally have three brains we've got

211
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:20,800
<font color="#CCCCCC">our neocortex which is kind</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of our the</font>

212
00:09:15,860 --> 00:09:23,930
brain that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we use to create language and</font>

213
00:09:20,799 --> 00:09:25,579
technology you know the the<font color="#CCCCCC"> brain that</font>

214
00:09:23,929 --> 00:09:28,069
<font color="#E5E5E5">allows us to go to the moon it's this</font>

215
00:09:25,580 --> 00:09:30,410
deductive reasoning brain has given us

216
00:09:28,070 --> 00:09:33,170
science or technology but just below it

217
00:09:30,409 --> 00:09:36,319
<font color="#E5E5E5">we have the limbic system we've got the</font>

218
00:09:33,169 --> 00:09:38,569
the cortex which is our heart brain but

219
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:39,860
it's in the head but this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is our madman</font>

220
00:09:38,570 --> 00:09:42,170
or you would also called the mammalian

221
00:09:39,860 --> 00:09:44,539
brain of a million or neocortex

222
00:09:42,169 --> 00:09:48,049
mammalian<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay this pavilion brain is</font>

223
00:09:44,539 --> 00:09:50,089
the same brain that animals but Amelia

224
00:09:48,049 --> 00:09:51,949
mammal type animals have its associated

225
00:09:50,090 --> 00:09:55,220
with warm feelings with connecting with

226
00:09:51,950 --> 00:09:57,530
one another with love with community and

227
00:09:55,220 --> 00:10:00,769
then there's that reptilian brain that

228
00:09:57,529 --> 00:10:03,589
that brain stem I think you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> call</font>

229
00:10:00,769 --> 00:10:06,259
<font color="#CCCCCC">that via the medulla down into the brain</font>

230
00:10:03,590 --> 00:10:07,610
stem<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is our reptilian brain this is</font>

231
00:10:06,259 --> 00:10:09,730
that this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is the balls brain this is the</font>

232
00:10:07,610 --> 00:10:12,649
one<font color="#CCCCCC"> that that's associated with</font>

233
00:10:09,730 --> 00:10:14,450
sexuality and safety you know they hold

234
00:10:12,649 --> 00:10:16,250
a reptilian brain because alligators you

235
00:10:14,450 --> 00:10:19,610
know all its thinking about is eating

236
00:10:16,250 --> 00:10:21,350
and screwing and that's where<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's</font>

237
00:10:19,610 --> 00:10:24,139
like our route brain<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's the brain</font>

238
00:10:21,350 --> 00:10:25,909
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> extends itself down into our into</font>

239
00:10:24,139 --> 00:10:27,769
our peripheral nervous system which is

240
00:10:25,909 --> 00:10:29,539
all down here right when we say I'm

241
00:10:27,769 --> 00:10:31,970
thinking we really were doing<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font>

242
00:10:29,539 --> 00:10:34,370
neocortex what we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> saying we're</font>

243
00:10:31,970 --> 00:10:37,759
feeling we're doing this nice<font color="#E5E5E5"> are trains</font>

244
00:10:34,370 --> 00:10:41,389
<font color="#E5E5E5">the car cortex you know father's son</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font>

245
00:10:37,759 --> 00:10:43,669
called Jesus the Son harm the Holy

246
00:10:41,389 --> 00:10:46,220
Spirit is that which guides us that we

247
00:10:43,669 --> 00:10:48,529
<font color="#CCCCCC">don't see right that what guides us what</font>

248
00:10:46,220 --> 00:10:50,990
who's beating your heart right who's

249
00:10:48,529 --> 00:10:53,689
digesting your food who's dilating your

250
00:10:50,990 --> 00:10:56,840
eyes who's helping the bowels move down

251
00:10:53,690 --> 00:10:58,370
there who's doing<font color="#CCCCCC"> that that spirit that</font>

252
00:10:56,840 --> 00:11:01,009
<font color="#E5E5E5">Holy Spirit and this is just a metaphor</font>

253
00:10:58,370 --> 00:11:03,950
that the ancients use that we can see

254
00:11:01,009 --> 00:11:05,980
parallels to in regard to the science

255
00:11:03,950 --> 00:11:09,430
that we use today to explain<font color="#E5E5E5"> everything</font>

256
00:11:05,980 --> 00:11:12,340
but it's there so and<font color="#CCCCCC"> i'm a bit</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of a</font>

257
00:11:09,429 --> 00:11:15,099
poet getting figured it out<font color="#E5E5E5"> i tend to</font>

258
00:11:12,340 --> 00:11:18,700
think we lost the meeting of a lot of

259
00:11:15,100 --> 00:11:21,759
the brilliance the poetic meeting that

260
00:11:18,700 --> 00:11:24,820
can be<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's pointing to the scientific</font>

261
00:11:21,759 --> 00:11:27,340
reality that we use today right well

262
00:11:24,820 --> 00:11:29,260
which<font color="#CCCCCC"> is all inside of us really and</font>

263
00:11:27,340 --> 00:11:33,070
like you said pointing back to really

264
00:11:29,259 --> 00:11:37,539
what's all within us the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Son and the</font>

265
00:11:33,070 --> 00:11:40,600
Holy Spirit are also there its

266
00:11:37,539 --> 00:11:43,809
associated with emotion feeling loved

267
00:11:40,600 --> 00:11:46,360
and down Finn<font color="#CCCCCC"> else</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it's that intuition</font>

268
00:11:43,809 --> 00:11:48,669
is that you that does the things you

269
00:11:46,360 --> 00:11:51,070
need done without you having to do<font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font>

270
00:11:48,669 --> 00:11:52,120
and you stared recently I love this too

271
00:11:51,070 --> 00:11:54,280
and I actually thought<font color="#CCCCCC"> of you this</font>

272
00:11:52,120 --> 00:11:55,779
weekend it's so crazy because you share

273
00:11:54,279 --> 00:11:58,209
in a video about and this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is so</font>

274
00:11:55,779 --> 00:12:00,220
beautiful that you again as a as a big

275
00:11:58,210 --> 00:12:02,650
tough guy right shared this about crying

276
00:12:00,220 --> 00:12:05,230
and the importance and just the

277
00:12:02,649 --> 00:12:06,490
beautiful power that is crying and not

278
00:12:05,230 --> 00:12:08,019
holding it back and how it's actually

279
00:12:06,490 --> 00:12:10,120
unnatural when we try to hold it back

280
00:12:08,019 --> 00:12:11,289
and I<font color="#E5E5E5"> and I don't have a problem you</font>

281
00:12:10,120 --> 00:12:13,600
know<font color="#E5E5E5"> women don't have a problem with</font>

282
00:12:11,289 --> 00:12:15,549
crying you're softer yeah right<font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> mean</font>

283
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:17,500
we know I I can try you know of<font color="#E5E5E5"> course</font>

284
00:12:15,549 --> 00:12:18,699
them but usually spot<font color="#CCCCCC"> us on my own that</font>

285
00:12:17,500 --> 00:12:20,649
I don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> have a problem with crying and</font>

286
00:12:18,700 --> 00:12:22,210
this weekend I had an opportunity<font color="#E5E5E5"> when</font>

287
00:12:20,649 --> 00:12:24,669
I've met with a friend a dear friend of

288
00:12:22,210 --> 00:12:26,230
mine another woman<font color="#CCCCCC"> as well and we were</font>

289
00:12:24,669 --> 00:12:28,899
getting into<font color="#E5E5E5"> some</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> things that were that</font>

290
00:12:26,230 --> 00:12:30,879
<font color="#E5E5E5">we were feeling</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and stuff and she was</font>

291
00:12:28,899 --> 00:12:33,009
