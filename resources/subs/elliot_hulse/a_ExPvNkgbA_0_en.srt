on the path to becoming a stronger

wrote about<font color="#E5E5E5"> how exercise is medicine</font>

right and we take<font color="#E5E5E5"> it for granted that</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">you know an exercise is an exercise but</font>

10
00:00:18,269 --> 00:00:21,868
there are parameters that can be

11
00:00:19,618 --> 00:00:23,579
adjusted to give your<font color="#E5E5E5"> body at different</font>

00:00:21,868 --> 00:00:25,379
physiological response and ultimately

13
00:00:23,579 --> 00:00:29,309
make you a<font color="#E5E5E5"> different version of yourself</font>

14
00:00:25,379 --> 00:00:31,469
very quickly if you take running for

15
00:00:29,309 --> 00:00:33,869
example as an exercise well there's many

16
00:00:31,469 --> 00:00:36,238
different ways<font color="#CCCCCC"> to apply running by</font>

adjusting the parameters right are you

running long distances right that's I'm

a physical different physiological

response doing this then if I did this

22
00:00:51,469 --> 00:00:57,480
right sprinting very simple are you

23
00:00:55,500 --> 00:00:59,429
sprinting or you're judging what are the

24
00:00:57,479 --> 00:01:03,569
parameters associated with it are you

00:00:59,429 --> 00:01:05,159
<font color="#E5E5E5">going for long intervals with low</font>

intensity or short intervals with high

27
00:01:05,159 --> 00:01:12,570
intensity right so exercise in and of

28
00:01:08,579 --> 00:01:14,789
itself is powerful but it needs to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be</font>

is going to be a psychological<font color="#CCCCCC"> effect of</font>

engage and you emotionalize the content

179
00:07:11,050 --> 00:07:14,050
the medicine which you know what

180
00:07:12,639 --> 00:07:15,579
normally happens with the physiologic

before what to do<font color="#E5E5E5"> that listen to music</font>

fucked up<font color="#E5E5E5"> in his relationships because</font>

of the medicine that he's<font color="#E5E5E5"> been taking</font>

236
00:09:11,299 --> 00:09:15,829
over time if you keep<font color="#CCCCCC"> doing the same</font>

237
00:09:13,639 --> 00:09:17,269
thing you're doing in the gym and you're

00:09:15,830 --> 00:09:19,520
not<font color="#E5E5E5"> getting the results that you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> want in</font>

your character in a way that<font color="#CCCCCC"> you that</font>

241
00:09:22,159 --> 00:09:26,899
isn't resourceful it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not helping you</font>

242
00:09:24,820 --> 00:09:30,440
so you ask yourself what's more

243
00:09:26,899 --> 00:09:35,449
important you know the<font color="#E5E5E5"> the outer shell</font>

244
00:09:30,440 --> 00:09:38,330
and I don't I<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't say that in a way</font>

245
00:09:35,450 --> 00:09:41,500
that makes<font color="#CCCCCC"> it that lessens its value I</font>

246
00:09:38,330 --> 00:09:43,970
do find like new there's great value in

247
00:09:41,500 --> 00:09:47,690
aesthetics there's great value in<font color="#E5E5E5"> having</font>

248
00:09:43,970 --> 00:09:50,240
a good<font color="#E5E5E5"> looking body but if it's at the</font>

249
00:09:47,690 --> 00:09:51,980
expense of other things you've got<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

250
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:54,830
ask yourself is<font color="#CCCCCC"> that if</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this is the</font>

251
00:09:51,980 --> 00:09:56,300
right medicine for me if you're spending

252
00:09:54,830 --> 00:09:58,100
all your<font color="#CCCCCC"> time building up a certain</font>

253
00:09:56,299 --> 00:10:00,259
particular body and it requires a

254
00:09:58,100 --> 00:10:03,680
certain amount<font color="#E5E5E5"> of time energy resources</font>

255
00:10:00,259 --> 00:10:07,549
and focus in order to<font color="#E5E5E5"> make that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> happen</font>

256
00:10:03,679 --> 00:10:10,399
at the expense of say your career your

257
00:10:07,549 --> 00:10:12,589
school your relationships your life

258
00:10:10,399 --> 00:10:14,990
mastery as a whole or anything else<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

259
00:10:12,590 --> 00:10:16,220
you value then maybe it isn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> the right</font>

260
00:10:14,990 --> 00:10:21,500
medicine and you've got<font color="#CCCCCC"> to check</font>

261
00:10:16,220 --> 00:10:23,149
yourself the only<font color="#CCCCCC"> question that really</font>

262
00:10:21,500 --> 00:10:24,649
ever matters is how that's working out

263
00:10:23,149 --> 00:10:26,029
for you and you gotta look at you know

264
00:10:24,649 --> 00:10:29,779
look<font color="#E5E5E5"> at how the things that you're doing</font>

265
00:10:26,029 --> 00:10:31,730
the exercises and the habits the rituals

266
00:10:29,779 --> 00:10:35,389
that you engage in on a daily basis

267
00:10:31,730 --> 00:10:36,740
which make the response chronic your

268
00:10:35,389 --> 00:10:38,720
physiological and psychological response

269
00:10:36,740 --> 00:10:42,680
chronic are they helping you only heard

270
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:44,570
me I think one of the issues is that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we</font>

271
00:10:42,679 --> 00:10:46,579
don't believe we've got<font color="#E5E5E5"> options you know</font>

272
00:10:44,570 --> 00:10:47,800
or we don't know that<font color="#CCCCCC"> there are other</font>

273
00:10:46,580 --> 00:10:49,300
options and

274
00:10:47,799 --> 00:10:52,000
and the benefits are associated<font color="#CCCCCC"> with the</font>

275
00:10:49,299 --> 00:10:53,620
other options right so for example it

276
00:10:52,000 --> 00:11:00,039
took me a long time<font color="#CCCCCC"> you're</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> right because</font>

277
00:10:53,620 --> 00:11:02,110
i started my exploration with physical

278
00:11:00,039 --> 00:11:03,699
training using a barbell and dumbbells

279
00:11:02,110 --> 00:11:06,278
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> strength training barbell training</font>

280
00:11:03,700 --> 00:11:08,860

284

t-ball it was horrible at it and<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'd be</font>

285
00:11:19,570 --> 00:11:23,230
out<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the outfield just picking daisies</font>

286
00:11:21,429 --> 00:11:25,389
in the ball and rolled by so my parents

287
00:11:23,230 --> 00:11:27,490
<font color="#CCCCCC">realized and go and work out for him so</font>

288
00:11:25,389 --> 00:11:31,480
I played<font color="#E5E5E5"> football was football just yeah</font>

00:11:42,669 --> 00:11:48,639

done changes you it changes<font color="#CCCCCC"> you not just</font>

lost weight but changes my mind changed

340
00:13:44,078 --> 00:13:53,258
my character changes your way of being

341
00:13:47,169 --> 00:13:55,448
has<font color="#CCCCCC"> exercise is fucking medicine most of</font>

342
00:13:53,259 --> 00:13:57,129
<font color="#E5E5E5">what I do these days revolve around as</font>

343
00:13:55,448 --> 00:13:59,198
far as my medicine is concerned and I'll

344
00:13:57,129 --> 00:14:00,699
talk far more about<font color="#E5E5E5"> this incoming videos</font>

345
00:13:59,198 --> 00:14:01,719
in the coming months<font color="#E5E5E5"> and so forth but I</font>

346
00:14:00,698 --> 00:14:03,789
just would think it's very important for

347
00:14:01,720 --> 00:14:06,910
you to know that a day doesn't go by

348
00:14:03,789 --> 00:14:12,120
where I don't do bioenergetic breathing

349
00:14:06,909 --> 00:14:15,938
or Tai Chi energy cultivating exercises

350
00:14:12,120 --> 00:14:20,589
right when they're when you're in a mode

351
00:14:15,938 --> 00:14:25,149
of growth you need to do things that are

352
00:14:20,589 --> 00:14:28,050
anabolic and oftentimes anabolism cannot

353
00:14:25,149 --> 00:14:32,708
be accessed unless there is rest

354
00:14:28,049 --> 00:14:34,628
recovery so in the same way that sleep

355
00:14:32,708 --> 00:14:38,169
is necessary because it gives you that

356
00:14:34,629 --> 00:14:39,819
dose of anabolic juice in order<font color="#E5E5E5"> to help</font>

357
00:14:38,169 --> 00:14:44,128
<font color="#E5E5E5">you recover from your activities of the</font>

358
00:14:39,818 --> 00:14:46,808
day you can<font color="#CCCCCC"> support that anabolic boost</font>

359
00:14:44,129 --> 00:14:48,970
by doing exercises that stimulate your

360
00:14:46,808 --> 00:14:51,338
nervous system in the very same way that

361
00:14:48,970 --> 00:14:53,910
sleep does parasympathetic stimulation

362
00:14:51,339 --> 00:14:53,910
through

363
00:14:59,049 --> 00:15:04,208
breathing exercises right I mean I

364
00:15:02,528 --> 00:15:07,330
almost change instantly based on the way

365
00:15:04,208 --> 00:15:09,789
I breathe I've done videos you've seen

366
00:15:07,330 --> 00:15:14,830

up here somewhere where I'm showing you

368
00:15:14,830 --> 00:15:23,440

up<font color="#E5E5E5"> ah done videos like this well that's</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">that slow rhythmical breathing coupled</font>
