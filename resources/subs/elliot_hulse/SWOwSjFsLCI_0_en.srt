1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,240
so our buddy al has what he<font color="#E5E5E5"> calls a</font>

2
00:00:03,149 --> 00:00:08,009
speaking impediment so<font color="#CCCCCC"> essentially he</font>

3
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:09,630
chokes up and he stutters whenever he

4
00:00:08,009 --> 00:00:11,099
speaks with people and this is<font color="#CCCCCC"> something</font>

5
00:00:09,630 --> 00:00:13,710
that he's been<font color="#CCCCCC"> dealing with</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> all his</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> life</font>

6
00:00:11,099 --> 00:00:15,359
he's been<font color="#E5E5E5"> to several doctors it's that</font>

7
00:00:13,710 --> 00:00:18,118
serious he's been to several doctors and

8
00:00:15,359 --> 00:00:20,939
his the only thing that they can<font color="#CCCCCC"> offer</font>

9
00:00:18,118 --> 00:00:22,980
him is that the brains part of his brain

10
00:00:20,939 --> 00:00:25,768
is associated with verbal communication

11
00:00:22,980 --> 00:00:27,868
has been<font color="#E5E5E5"> damaged seriously damaged and</font>

12
00:00:25,768 --> 00:00:29,579
there's nothing<font color="#CCCCCC"> he can do so that's it</font>

13
00:00:27,868 --> 00:00:31,800
he's got<font color="#E5E5E5"> to deal the rest of his life</font>

14
00:00:29,579 --> 00:00:33,899
<font color="#CCCCCC">with this inability to speak clearly</font>

15
00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:35,640
with it with<font color="#E5E5E5"> people he's got all his</font>

16
00:00:33,899 --> 00:00:37,739
shit together apparently he works out

17
00:00:35,640 --> 00:00:40,350
sounds like he's a really stand-up guy

18
00:00:37,738 --> 00:00:42,000
you know the<font color="#E5E5E5"> thing</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is that relationships</font>

19
00:00:40,350 --> 00:00:44,969
are difficult for him he doesn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> have</font>

20
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:46,500
very many friends he probably doesn't

21
00:00:44,969 --> 00:00:48,989
mention it but<font color="#E5E5E5"> would have difficulty</font>

22
00:00:46,500 --> 00:00:51,628
speaking with and developing a

23
00:00:48,988 --> 00:00:53,878
relationship with a woman so he's

24
00:00:51,628 --> 00:00:57,179
feeling lonely and he's<font color="#E5E5E5"> feeling confused</font>

25
00:00:53,878 --> 00:01:00,119
a bit frustrated<font color="#E5E5E5"> he comes to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> us</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> not for</font>

26
00:00:57,179 --> 00:01:02,488
a answer<font color="#E5E5E5"> or a solution because obviously</font>

27
00:01:00,119 --> 00:01:03,750
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to doctors hasn't solved these</font>

28
00:01:02,488 --> 00:01:05,099
problems I<font color="#CCCCCC"> mean there's only so much</font>

29
00:01:03,750 --> 00:01:08,909
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we could do through</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> YouTube videos</font>

30
00:01:05,099 --> 00:01:12,118
but<font color="#CCCCCC"> a perspective and I'd like</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to offer</font>

31
00:01:08,909 --> 00:01:15,000
you one what<font color="#CCCCCC"> I would invite you to do is</font>

32
00:01:12,118 --> 00:01:17,310
<font color="#CCCCCC">to develop to the highest degree</font>

33
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:21,959
possible your ability to<font color="#E5E5E5"> kumin it</font>

34
00:01:17,310 --> 00:01:24,390
communicate through writing in

35
00:01:21,959 --> 00:01:27,329
particular writing<font color="#E5E5E5"> I would say a form of</font>

36
00:01:24,390 --> 00:01:29,700
art you know because it allows you to

37
00:01:27,329 --> 00:01:32,728
express yourself which is cathartic for

38
00:01:29,700 --> 00:01:35,549
you and in general you know we all want

39
00:01:32,728 --> 00:01:37,920
to express that which is within us and

40
00:01:35,549 --> 00:01:40,020
we<font color="#CCCCCC"> all find different ways to express it</font>

41
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:41,879
you have are impeded in your ability to

42
00:01:40,019 --> 00:01:43,408
verbally communicate but<font color="#E5E5E5"> i'm sure</font>

43
00:01:41,879 --> 00:01:46,289
<font color="#E5E5E5">there's so much that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you want to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> share</font>

44
00:01:43,409 --> 00:01:48,719
<font color="#CCCCCC">with people</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> i would invite you to begin</font>

45
00:01:46,290 --> 00:01:51,210
writing and creating a platform for

46
00:01:48,719 --> 00:01:55,289
yourself in<font color="#E5E5E5"> order to share your deepest</font>

47
00:01:51,209 --> 00:01:57,359
thoughts or journal with those who may

48
00:01:55,290 --> 00:02:00,090
be interested in the type of things that

49
00:01:57,359 --> 00:02:02,670
you're<font color="#CCCCCC"> interested</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> in well as well start</font>

50
00:02:00,090 --> 00:02:05,880
a blog you know practice your writing

51
00:02:02,670 --> 00:02:09,118
start a blog start a newsletter find

52
00:02:05,879 --> 00:02:12,530
different ways where you could use

53
00:02:09,118 --> 00:02:14,750
literature or poetry

54
00:02:12,530 --> 00:02:17,240
or journaling like<font color="#E5E5E5"> I described where you</font>

55
00:02:14,750 --> 00:02:18,979
just relay your subjective experience to

56
00:02:17,240 --> 00:02:21,189
people through your through your website

57
00:02:18,979 --> 00:02:23,299
<font color="#E5E5E5">or something of that nature and then</font>

58
00:02:21,189 --> 00:02:24,889
become a part of a<font color="#E5E5E5"> community I know</font>

59
00:02:23,300 --> 00:02:27,380
there<font color="#E5E5E5"> are so many different blogging</font>

60
00:02:24,889 --> 00:02:30,559
communities that if you were to take

61
00:02:27,379 --> 00:02:32,269
your art and you were to subject it to

62
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:35,840
the scrutiny but also also<font color="#E5E5E5"> the support</font>

63
00:02:32,270 --> 00:02:38,450
<font color="#CCCCCC">of that community outside of that which</font>

64
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:40,400
would require you to speak you would

65
00:02:38,449 --> 00:02:46,280
find those you'd find other individuals

66
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:49,849
who also either benefit from due to an

67
00:02:46,280 --> 00:02:52,310
inability or just truly love expressing

68
00:02:49,849 --> 00:02:54,889
themselves through written communication

69
00:02:52,310 --> 00:02:57,199
and that would just<font color="#CCCCCC"> be one way for you</font>

70
00:02:54,889 --> 00:02:58,488
to<font color="#CCCCCC"> go about developing relationships</font>

71
00:02:57,199 --> 00:03:00,229
with other people without<font color="#CCCCCC"> you having to</font>

72
00:02:58,489 --> 00:03:02,300
speak to them you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> when you get an</font>

opportunity to share yourself with

this<font color="#E5E5E5"> over and over again in many</font>

different movies whether you know people

00:03:27,919 --> 00:03:32,179
who are pen pals or the case may be and

84
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:33,799
they've never met each other but they've

85
00:03:32,180 --> 00:03:35,569
fallen so deeply in love through this

86
00:03:33,799 --> 00:03:37,280
written communication and then when<font color="#E5E5E5"> they</font>

87
00:03:35,569 --> 00:03:39,049
finally meet<font color="#CCCCCC"> they're like complete</font>

opposites but<font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> doesn't matter because</font>

89
00:03:39,049 --> 00:03:43,519
they've shared so much of their hearts

90
00:03:41,479 --> 00:03:47,000
desires with with each other that<font color="#E5E5E5"> they</font>

91
00:03:43,519 --> 00:03:48,469
the relationship<font color="#CCCCCC"> is solidified through a</font>

92
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:51,979
deeper means than that of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

93
00:03:48,469 --> 00:03:54,859
superficial form so that's it dude give

00:03:51,979 --> 00:03:57,500
<font color="#E5E5E5">it a try if it's not writing try a</font>

95
00:03:54,859 --> 00:03:59,870
different form of art some way for<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

96
00:03:57,500 --> 00:04:01,909
to express<font color="#E5E5E5"> yourself but also more</font>

97
00:03:59,870 --> 00:04:04,189
importantly to put it in a place where

98
00:04:01,909 --> 00:04:08,979
other people can come to know like and

99
00:04:04,189 --> 00:04:08,979
appreciate you through it good luck
