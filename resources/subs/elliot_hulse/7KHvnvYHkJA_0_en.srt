62
00:02:37,080 --> 00:02:42,209
now few quotes Bravo Emerson of course

63
00:02:40,340 --> 00:02:43,950
every action is measured by the

64
00:02:42,209 --> 00:02:45,269
sentiment from which it proceeds meaning

65
00:02:43,949 --> 00:02:48,449
it doesn't matter what you do it matters

66
00:02:45,269 --> 00:02:51,150
who you are you I love my<font color="#CCCCCC"> friends so no</font>

67
00:02:48,449 --> 00:02:54,089
matter what<font color="#CCCCCC"> you do you're proceeding</font>

68
00:02:51,150 --> 00:02:56,430
from the sentiment of love the soil of

69
00:02:54,090 --> 00:02:58,500
love so anything that you plant in it is

70
00:02:56,430 --> 00:03:00,930
going to be fruitful it's going to

71
00:02:58,500 --> 00:03:03,530
increase your love because you are<font color="#CCCCCC"> loved</font>

72
00:03:00,930 --> 00:03:09,439
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> are that sentiment every action is</font>

73
00:03:03,530 --> 00:03:12,330
measured it grows it dies it is it lives

74
00:03:09,439 --> 00:03:14,250
by the sentiment from which it proceeds

75
00:03:12,330 --> 00:03:16,650
meaning you're coming from the strongest

76
00:03:14,250 --> 00:03:22,169
place dude so no matter what<font color="#CCCCCC"> you do</font>

77
00:03:16,650 --> 00:03:23,969
you've<font color="#E5E5E5"> already covered your basis so you</font>

78
00:03:22,169 --> 00:03:26,759
could decide to sweep the streets but

79
00:03:23,969 --> 00:03:28,439
<font color="#E5E5E5">bro when you sweep the streets you're</font>

80
00:03:26,759 --> 00:03:31,109
going to sweep with such love that

81
00:03:28,439 --> 00:03:33,329
you're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to increase the positive</font>

82
00:03:31,110 --> 00:03:36,000
vibrations in that area and<font color="#CCCCCC"> people who</font>

83
00:03:33,329 --> 00:03:37,950
walk that road won't even know why they

84
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:39,629
feel so good when they walk that road

85
00:03:37,949 --> 00:03:44,819
but it'll be<font color="#E5E5E5"> because you're spreading</font>

86
00:03:39,629 --> 00:03:48,599
your love you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can work in</font>

87
00:03:44,819 --> 00:03:52,769
construction you can mow lawns you can

88
00:03:48,599 --> 00:03:54,959
write books you can paint paintings you

89
00:03:52,769 --> 00:04:00,299
can make videos<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can do absolutely</font>

90
00:03:54,959 --> 00:04:03,120
<font color="#E5E5E5">anything you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> could plant trees you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> can</font>

91
00:04:00,299 --> 00:04:04,739
do absolutely anything and it's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

92
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:08,700
<font color="#E5E5E5">be infused with that which is most</font>

93
00:04:04,739 --> 00:04:12,299
powerful and<font color="#E5E5E5"> that is your love another</font>

94
00:04:08,699 --> 00:04:16,038
really great quote by Emerson is nothing

95
00:04:12,299 --> 00:04:17,340
amazing has ever been created without

96
00:04:16,038 --> 00:04:19,918
enthused

97
00:04:17,339 --> 00:04:23,009
nothing great has ever been<font color="#CCCCCC"> done without</font>

98
00:04:19,918 --> 00:04:24,539
doozy azum that word enthusiasm is

99
00:04:23,009 --> 00:04:28,469
interesting because if you break it down

100
00:04:24,540 --> 00:04:31,949
its root is in Theo's meaning from<font color="#E5E5E5"> God</font>

101
00:04:28,470 --> 00:04:34,680
and feels<font color="#E5E5E5"> God and you my friend when you</font>

102
00:04:31,949 --> 00:04:38,040
<font color="#E5E5E5">bring your enthusiasm to all you do it</font>

103
00:04:34,680 --> 00:04:44,060
is a work of God you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> putting yourself</font>

104
00:04:38,040 --> 00:04:48,689
in the river<font color="#E5E5E5"> of love of God enthusiasm</font>

105
00:04:44,060 --> 00:04:50,959
you can't go wrong<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't worry so much</font>

106
00:04:48,689 --> 00:04:55,969
about what your actual activity is

107
00:04:50,959 --> 00:05:01,459
because the groundwork has been laid for

108
00:04:55,970 --> 00:05:03,840
you to be successful in whatever you do

109
00:05:01,459 --> 00:05:05,939

114
00:05:13,199 --> 00:05:16,500
everyone can receive your love not

115
00:05:14,490 --> 00:05:17,879
everyone can receive<font color="#CCCCCC"> my love it's</font>

116
00:05:16,500 --> 00:05:19,978
<font color="#E5E5E5">fucking Elliott Hulse thinks he's so</font>

heartstrings because it'll<font color="#CCCCCC"> be that much</font>

123
00:05:31,740 --> 00:05:36,810
more powerful see not everybody lives in

124
