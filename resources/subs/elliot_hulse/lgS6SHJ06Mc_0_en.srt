29
00:01:00,659 --> 00:01:06,688
slew of weird-ass side effects and a lot

30
00:01:04,469 --> 00:01:08,039
of them are tix you know neurological

32
00:01:08,040 --> 00:01:11,250
as simple as<font color="#E5E5E5"> that maybe Tourette's I</font>

33
00:01:09,868 --> 00:01:12,540
don't know go get diagnosed or maybe

there to be anything two things two

37
00:01:18,239 --> 00:01:20,849
paradigms two ideas that I want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

38
00:01:19,650 --> 00:01:22,890
support<font color="#CCCCCC"> you with beyond that the very</font>

39
00:01:20,849 --> 00:01:24,239
first one<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that the nervous system we</font>

40
00:01:22,890 --> 00:01:25,530
all know this I've spoken about this if

41
00:01:24,239 --> 00:01:29,219
you follow me on<font color="#E5E5E5"> strengthener vez system</font>

42
00:01:25,530 --> 00:01:31,170
is the energizing system of your

43
00:01:29,219 --> 00:01:32,489
muscular system right it's what's

44
00:01:31,170 --> 00:01:33,960
happening neurologically so you've got

45
00:01:32,489 --> 00:01:35,039
that you<font color="#E5E5E5"> got the brain you got the</font>

47
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:39,118
system you know it all works like an

48
00:01:37,349 --> 00:01:40,919
electric system that shocks your muscle

49
00:01:39,118 --> 00:01:42,540
to do what it wants to<font color="#E5E5E5"> do now normally</font>

50
00:01:40,920 --> 00:01:43,829
there's a parent and efferent messages

51
00:01:42,540 --> 00:01:45,149
coming out so you know how to act

52
00:01:43,828 --> 00:01:47,908
appropriately based on the environment

53
00:01:45,149 --> 00:01:49,590
right but perhaps there is an imbalance

54
00:01:47,909 --> 00:01:51,780
between the a fair Janie<font color="#CCCCCC"> Faron it's just</font>

56
00:01:51,780 --> 00:01:54,978
you're just<font color="#E5E5E5"> doing shit you're not you're</font>

57
00:01:52,978 --> 00:01:57,179
thinking<font color="#CCCCCC"> about</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> doing it it just happens</font>

58
00:01:54,978 --> 00:01:58,798
what we can do because<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're not the</font>

59
00:01:57,180 --> 00:01:59,579
only one so you might be<font color="#CCCCCC"> more obvious in</font>

60
00:01:58,799 --> 00:02:03,479
you and it might be<font color="#CCCCCC"> a little bit</font>

61
00:01:59,578 --> 00:02:05,459
stranger in you but we're all harboring

62
00:02:03,478 --> 00:02:06,868
different forms of neurotic holding

63
00:02:05,459 --> 00:02:08,489
patterns you know if you're watching

64
00:02:06,868 --> 00:02:09,699
this right now just pay attention to

65
00:02:08,489 --> 00:02:10,989
your body

66
00:02:09,699 --> 00:02:12,280
people hold their feet tight a lot of

67
00:02:10,989 --> 00:02:13,900
<font color="#CCCCCC">people hold their hands tight they don't</font>
