1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,899
hey whats up guys yesterday we spoke

2
00:00:01,589 --> 00:00:09,630
about<font color="#E5E5E5"> the arduous and sometimes long</font>

3
00:00:05,899 --> 00:00:11,339
time it takes between where we are and

4
00:00:09,630 --> 00:00:13,769
where<font color="#CCCCCC"> we want to be in other words</font>

5
00:00:11,339 --> 00:00:16,500
reaching your goals sometimes takes

6
00:00:13,769 --> 00:00:19,320
years I know a lot of us in our

7
00:00:16,500 --> 00:00:20,910
fast-paced culture<font color="#E5E5E5"> want things now but I</font>

8
00:00:19,320 --> 00:00:22,829
gave an example based on my own

9
00:00:20,910 --> 00:00:25,560
experience about how it took me five

10
00:00:22,829 --> 00:00:28,439
years of working consistently<font color="#CCCCCC"> self</font>

11
00:00:25,559 --> 00:00:32,159
<font color="#CCCCCC">sacrifice sometimes</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it was worried out</font>

12
00:00:28,439 --> 00:00:34,170
in fear on my<font color="#CCCCCC"> journey to gaining over</font>

13
00:00:32,159 --> 00:00:36,209
million subscribers on my strength camp

14
00:00:34,170 --> 00:00:38,700
youtube channel<font color="#CCCCCC"> I showed you a graph</font>

15
00:00:36,210 --> 00:00:42,660
where it seemed as if<font color="#CCCCCC"> the Sun would</font>

16
00:00:38,700 --> 00:00:46,050
<font color="#E5E5E5">never rise and for years it didn't until</font>

17
00:00:42,659 --> 00:00:48,919
boom there was a skyrocket in subscriber

18
00:00:46,049 --> 00:00:53,119
<font color="#CCCCCC">shitting I think</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that graph just</font>

19
00:00:48,920 --> 00:00:57,329
exemplifies one of the principles of our

20
00:00:53,119 --> 00:00:59,640
journey of our heroes journey becoming a

21
00:00:57,329 --> 00:01:00,689
stronger version of ourselves and today

22
00:00:59,640 --> 00:01:02,730
I wanted to talk about one of the

23
00:01:00,689 --> 00:01:05,579
elements of<font color="#E5E5E5"> your journey but before I</font>

24
00:01:02,729 --> 00:01:08,158
get<font color="#CCCCCC"> started just</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> wanted to share some of</font>

25
00:01:05,579 --> 00:01:09,810
the ideas that I spoke<font color="#CCCCCC"> about it my grow</font>

26
00:01:08,159 --> 00:01:12,510
stronger experience this weekend

27
00:01:09,810 --> 00:01:15,329
especially<font color="#CCCCCC"> as it relates</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to the hero's</font>

28
00:01:12,510 --> 00:01:18,868
journey and why I always use that<font color="#CCCCCC"> as a</font>

29
00:01:15,329 --> 00:01:20,819
map or a metaphor for your own personal

30
00:01:18,868 --> 00:01:23,849
growth and for my own personal growth

31
00:01:20,819 --> 00:01:27,569
you see the hero's journey pattern in

32
00:01:23,849 --> 00:01:30,118
all types of epics all types of

33
00:01:27,569 --> 00:01:33,228
mythology and you even<font color="#E5E5E5"> see it in the</font>

34
00:01:30,118 --> 00:01:36,180
most popular<font color="#E5E5E5"> movies in pop culture it</font>

35
00:01:33,228 --> 00:01:39,868
seems to<font color="#CCCCCC"> be a archetype or recurring</font>

36
00:01:36,180 --> 00:01:42,000
pattern of how human beings evolve and

37
00:01:39,868 --> 00:01:44,609
<font color="#E5E5E5">at the grow stronger experience I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> also</font>

38
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:47,819
likened it<font color="#E5E5E5"> onto or use the example of</font>

39
00:01:44,609 --> 00:01:51,180
cell mitosis and how a cell goes from

40
00:01:47,819 --> 00:01:53,459
being one being by itself being calm

41
00:01:51,180 --> 00:01:56,460
cool collected everything's all right to

42
00:01:53,459 --> 00:01:59,639
the process that<font color="#E5E5E5"> allows or creates</font>

43
00:01:56,459 --> 00:02:02,209
turbulence or chaos within it remember

44
00:01:59,640 --> 00:02:05,549
this from biology class it met

45
00:02:02,209 --> 00:02:08,399
interphase prophase metaphase anaphase

46
00:02:05,549 --> 00:02:12,120
telophase this now cell reproduces or or

47
00:02:08,399 --> 00:02:13,259
becomes more of itself a self becomes a

48
00:02:12,120 --> 00:02:15,900
stronger version of its

49
00:02:13,259 --> 00:02:18,179
essentially because it is by itself it

50
00:02:15,900 --> 00:02:20,459
has turmoil chaos and then all of a

51
00:02:18,180 --> 00:02:22,950
sudden<font color="#CCCCCC"> there's a splitting from the</font>

52
00:02:20,459 --> 00:02:25,319
inside a tearing apart from the inside

53
00:02:22,949 --> 00:02:27,089
you can watch a<font color="#CCCCCC"> video about</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> cell mitosis</font>

54
00:02:25,318 --> 00:02:31,199
on youtube if you want to actually see

55
00:02:27,090 --> 00:02:33,269
what it looks like<font color="#CCCCCC"> but then the tearing</font>

56
00:02:31,199 --> 00:02:37,919
apart on the inside causes a situation

57
00:02:33,269 --> 00:02:42,239
where the cell then splits into two<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's</font>

58
00:02:37,919 --> 00:02:45,598
reorganized at a higher order this is a

59
00:02:42,239 --> 00:02:48,810
theme in biology it is a theme in life

60
00:02:45,598 --> 00:02:51,358
it is a theme in your<font color="#E5E5E5"> life so you're</font>

61
00:02:48,810 --> 00:02:53,430
always<font color="#E5E5E5"> on a hero's journey in some way</font>

62
00:02:51,359 --> 00:02:56,639
<font color="#CCCCCC">shape or form at various levels because</font>

63
00:02:53,430 --> 00:02:57,750
you're always growing stronger you're

64
00:02:56,639 --> 00:02:59,609
always becoming a stronger version

65
00:02:57,750 --> 00:03:04,079
yourself at<font color="#CCCCCC"> least that's my assumption</font>

66
00:02:59,609 --> 00:03:05,909
some people devolve we evolve so one<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

67
00:03:04,079 --> 00:03:09,469
the elements<font color="#E5E5E5"> that I wanted to share with</font>

68
00:03:05,908 --> 00:03:12,179
you comes from one<font color="#CCCCCC"> of my favorite books</font>

69
00:03:09,469 --> 00:03:14,669
depicting a hero's journey and that<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

70
00:03:12,180 --> 00:03:15,900
the alchemist by paulo<font color="#E5E5E5"> qua hello</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i'm not</font>

74
00:03:22,859 --> 00:03:27,510
popular powerful book I've read it

75
00:03:25,079 --> 00:03:29,310
several times I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think anybody who's</font>

76
00:03:27,509 --> 00:03:31,138
watching these videos should read the

77
00:03:29,310 --> 00:03:33,719
frigging book it's incredible but what

78
00:03:31,139 --> 00:03:37,349
element in our the young boy of the

79
00:03:33,719 --> 00:03:39,568
<font color="#E5E5E5">story the boys story that stuck out to</font>

80
00:03:37,348 --> 00:03:42,060
me and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I began</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> looking for</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it in my life</font>

81
00:03:39,568 --> 00:03:43,668
and I<font color="#E5E5E5"> begin pointing it out to others as</font>

82
00:03:42,060 --> 00:03:48,329
they consult with me and that is

83
00:03:43,669 --> 00:03:52,049
beginner's luck so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> going to read a</font>

84
00:03:48,329 --> 00:03:53,310
quote from the book here so sort of

85
00:03:52,049 --> 00:03:55,680
depict<font color="#E5E5E5"> it and then I'd</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> like to talk</font>

86
00:03:53,310 --> 00:03:57,598
about some of<font color="#E5E5E5"> my own experiences with</font>

87
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:59,549
beginner's luck and where it led to and

88
00:03:57,598 --> 00:04:03,869
then perhaps have you share some of

89
00:03:59,549 --> 00:04:06,500
yours so I'm in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> book it goes every</font>

90
00:04:03,870 --> 00:04:10,280
search begins with beginner's luck and

91
00:04:06,500 --> 00:04:15,509
every search ends with the victors being

92
00:04:10,280 --> 00:04:17,310
severely tested the boy remembered an

93
00:04:15,509 --> 00:04:19,500
old proverb from his<font color="#E5E5E5"> country it said</font>

94
00:04:17,310 --> 00:04:25,288
<font color="#CCCCCC">that the darkest hour of the night came</font>

95
00:04:19,500 --> 00:04:26,970
just before the dawn so I gann thinking

96
00:04:25,288 --> 00:04:29,399
about what this beginner's luck

97
00:04:26,970 --> 00:04:32,670
is all about and of course I find

98
00:04:29,399 --> 00:04:35,310
significance in things and<font color="#E5E5E5"> the way I</font>

99
00:04:32,670 --> 00:04:39,150
look at it is it's almost as if God or

100
00:04:35,310 --> 00:04:41,610
the universe has tapped you on the

101
00:04:39,149 --> 00:04:44,879
shoulder<font color="#E5E5E5"> and said yes go in that</font>

102
00:04:41,610 --> 00:04:49,410
direction with this bout of beginners

103
00:04:44,879 --> 00:04:51,600
luck right so for example in<font color="#CCCCCC"> my life as</font>

104
00:04:49,410 --> 00:04:54,000
a<font color="#E5E5E5"> fourteen-year-old I'm meddling with</font>

105
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:55,680
all kinds of things right let's do most

106
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:57,720
14 year olds because we're trying to

107
00:04:55,680 --> 00:05:00,030
figure our selves out we're discovering

108
00:04:57,720 --> 00:05:01,650
sports and our bodies right we're

109
00:05:00,029 --> 00:05:04,679
<font color="#CCCCCC">starting to grow we're suffering</font>

110
00:05:01,649 --> 00:05:07,979
discovering girls we're discovering all

111
00:05:04,680 --> 00:05:11,730
new types of ideas<font color="#CCCCCC"> that could lead to a</font>

112
00:05:07,980 --> 00:05:13,980
career or a vocation we're highly

113
00:05:11,730 --> 00:05:17,030
involved in many aspects of growing when

114
00:05:13,980 --> 00:05:20,610
we're at the better at the dawn of

115
00:05:17,029 --> 00:05:22,918
adolescence right 13 14 years<font color="#E5E5E5"> old and I</font>

116
00:05:20,610 --> 00:05:26,100
<font color="#CCCCCC">was about that time that I found weight</font>

117
00:05:22,918 --> 00:05:27,569
<font color="#CCCCCC">training barbells right just</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> like</font>

118
00:05:26,100 --> 00:05:30,120
anything else that would have come and

119
00:05:27,569 --> 00:05:32,099
<font color="#E5E5E5">go into my life</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> barbells showed up my</font>

120
00:05:30,120 --> 00:05:33,899
dad bought me some barbells and my uncle

121
00:05:32,100 --> 00:05:35,280
taught me<font color="#E5E5E5"> how to train in fact my blog</font>

122
00:05:33,899 --> 00:05:37,909
<font color="#E5E5E5">post today that you could read down</font>

123
00:05:35,279 --> 00:05:42,089
below talks a little bit about it<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

124
00:05:37,910 --> 00:05:44,490
man I gotta tell you it wouldn't but a

125
00:05:42,089 --> 00:05:46,909
few<font color="#CCCCCC"> weeks after me lifting these</font>

126
00:05:44,490 --> 00:05:49,079
barbells at the age of<font color="#CCCCCC"> 14 that I</font>

127
00:05:46,910 --> 00:05:52,370
accidentally looked into a bathroom

128
00:05:49,079 --> 00:05:55,800
mirror and<font color="#CCCCCC"> concei could see my back and</font>

129
00:05:52,370 --> 00:05:57,840
for the first<font color="#E5E5E5"> time I saw all kinds of</font>

130
00:05:55,800 --> 00:06:02,040
<font color="#E5E5E5">Whipple's and bumps and muscles in my</font>

131
00:05:57,839 --> 00:06:06,269
body that<font color="#CCCCCC"> I had never seen before</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I felt</font>

132
00:06:02,040 --> 00:06:09,030
euphoric I felt excited I felt<font color="#E5E5E5"> like I</font>

133
00:06:06,269 --> 00:06:13,500
had found a vein of gold that would

134
00:06:09,029 --> 00:06:17,579
enrich me for the rest of my<font color="#E5E5E5"> life I call</font>

135
00:06:13,500 --> 00:06:20,850
that beginner's luck not because of the

136
00:06:17,579 --> 00:06:24,978
yields gained it gained because of the

137
00:06:20,850 --> 00:06:28,800
activity the gains yield yield gains

138
00:06:24,978 --> 00:06:34,610
right I'm saying that right not because

139
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:34,610
of the thing again but<font color="#CCCCCC"> because of the</font>

140
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:43,610
significance of what it meant to me at

141
00:06:40,189 --> 00:06:45,228
that moment it meant to me that I could

142
00:06:43,610 --> 00:06:46,729
actually achieve a goal it meant to me

143
00:06:45,228 --> 00:06:49,129
that I could actually do something it

144
00:06:46,728 --> 00:06:50,870
meant to me that with consistent effort

145
00:06:49,129 --> 00:06:52,879
in a particular direction that I could

146
00:06:50,870 --> 00:06:56,090
have something<font color="#E5E5E5"> that I want and by</font>

00:06:52,879 --> 00:06:59,029
<font color="#E5E5E5">looking in the mirror I saw it it gave</font>

148
00:06:56,089 --> 00:07:01,728
me self-esteem it gave me the impetus to

149
00:06:59,029 --> 00:07:03,829
keep going in that direction because it

150
00:07:01,728 --> 00:07:06,500
was exciting and that's what beginner's

151
00:07:03,829 --> 00:07:07,939
luck is for you when you start out in

152
00:07:06,500 --> 00:07:09,050
something<font color="#E5E5E5"> when you start out on</font>

153
00:07:07,939 --> 00:07:11,418
something when you're out on your

154
00:07:09,050 --> 00:07:14,509
journey<font color="#E5E5E5"> and you've got that exciting</font>

155
00:07:11,418 --> 00:07:16,939
feeling you feel filled up in euphoric

156
00:07:14,509 --> 00:07:19,098
about a particular event<font color="#E5E5E5"> a circumstance</font>

157
00:07:16,939 --> 00:07:22,610
or something that someone said to<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

158
00:07:19,098 --> 00:07:24,918
<font color="#E5E5E5">and you feel like you cannot lose it's</font>

because<font color="#CCCCCC"> you're on the right path be</font>

160
00:07:24,918 --> 00:07:34,189
mindful though as the quote says

161
00:07:29,259 --> 00:07:36,259
beginner's luck precedes tests and this

162
00:07:34,189 --> 00:07:39,620
is<font color="#E5E5E5"> essentially where God or the universe</font>

163
00:07:36,259 --> 00:07:41,300
says<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay good gave you that little</font>

164
00:07:39,620 --> 00:07:44,209
blessing so that you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> that you're on</font>

165
00:07:41,300 --> 00:07:46,970
the right track but now I gotta see if

166
00:07:44,209 --> 00:07:49,279
you're worthy<font color="#E5E5E5"> of it was just how God</font>

167
00:07:46,970 --> 00:07:50,570
talks to me I gotta save your worthy of

168

<font color="#E5E5E5">this I know I want</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> see if you could</font>

169
00:07:50,569 --> 00:07:55,788
carry this gift I gave you a<font color="#E5E5E5"> little bit</font>

170
00:07:52,879 --> 00:08:01,848
of taste of it but are<font color="#E5E5E5"> you able to carry</font>

171
00:07:55,788 --> 00:08:03,949
it and those tests you know I'm 37 years

172
00:08:01,848 --> 00:08:06,319
old and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm still being tested in the</font>

173
00:08:03,949 --> 00:08:09,288
realm of weight lifting weight training

174
00:08:06,319 --> 00:08:12,139
physical training athletic sports

175
00:08:09,288 --> 00:08:13,968
performance in my health I next<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

176
00:08:12,139 --> 00:08:18,949
direction I was going to go in and God

177
00:08:13,968 --> 00:08:22,930
has completely molded me with it so the

178
00:08:18,949 --> 00:08:25,250
darkest hour precedes the Sun coming up

179
00:08:22,930 --> 00:08:28,250
meaning<font color="#CCCCCC"> there</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> going to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> be some</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> dark</font>
