1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,330
got a question from a young lady here

2
00:00:01,800 --> 00:00:05,190
we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> gonna call her Rihanna because her</font>

3
00:00:03,330 --> 00:00:07,349
name's felt almost like it but it's not

4
00:00:05,190 --> 00:00:09,120
and we want to keep her anonymous<font color="#CCCCCC"> anyway</font>

5
00:00:07,349 --> 00:00:12,199
she's 23 years old last year of

6
00:00:09,119 --> 00:00:14,518
<font color="#CCCCCC">University she's in love with a man</font>

7
00:00:12,199 --> 00:00:16,500
they've<font color="#E5E5E5"> been dating a few times over the</font>

8
00:00:14,519 --> 00:00:18,750
past month I feel this attraction

9
00:00:16,500 --> 00:00:21,359
between us but our relationship is vague

10
00:00:18,750 --> 00:00:24,079
she says I truly admire this person for

11
00:00:21,359 --> 00:00:28,289
his achievements in life his passion

12
00:00:24,079 --> 00:00:31,618
intellect and his beautiful heart I've

13
00:00:28,289 --> 00:00:33,090
also felt<font color="#CCCCCC"> that feeling of awe towards</font>

14
00:00:31,618 --> 00:00:35,039
him that you've described in<font color="#E5E5E5"> one of your</font>

15
00:00:33,090 --> 00:00:36,570
recent videos physically he's an

16
00:00:35,039 --> 00:00:39,439
attractive guy that likes to keep

17
00:00:36,570 --> 00:00:42,780
himself fit but for some strange reason

18
00:00:39,439 --> 00:00:44,750
there's a lack of lust to ride our

19
00:00:42,780 --> 00:00:47,640
relationship further so my question is

20
00:00:44,750 --> 00:00:50,009
can this admiration towards him generate

21
00:00:47,640 --> 00:00:57,629
lust over time basically she's wanting

22
00:00:50,009 --> 00:01:01,349
to know is it bird could we truly have

23
00:00:57,628 --> 00:01:03,718
<font color="#E5E5E5">the bonds of relationship if I am</font>

24
00:01:01,350 --> 00:01:07,400
attracted<font color="#CCCCCC"> to his intellect and perhaps</font>

25
00:01:03,719 --> 00:01:11,609
<font color="#E5E5E5">even his heart but there is no sexual</font>

26
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:13,409
affinity for one another I'm gonna go

27
00:01:11,609 --> 00:01:18,599
<font color="#CCCCCC">out</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> on a limb here and I'm going</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to say</font>

intelligence is experienced in both and

our balls sexuality there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> an</font>

intelligence associated with all three

associated with all three and four two

people to create<font color="#E5E5E5"> a deep</font>

and with one another the deepest bond

it's available to human beings with one

at a warming and a<font color="#CCCCCC"> relationship of mind</font>

55
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:34,378
be its strongest that's not to say it's

56
00:02:31,789 --> 00:02:36,328
necessary in all regards I'm sure that

57
00:02:34,378 --> 00:02:38,429
we could<font color="#CCCCCC"> use one to overpower the</font>

58
00:02:36,329 --> 00:02:41,310
absence of another but for the deepest

59
00:02:38,430 --> 00:02:46,040
bonds of humanity to occur we not only

60
00:02:41,310 --> 00:02:47,848
need to respect each other

61
00:02:46,039 --> 00:02:49,650
intellectually and like you said you

62
00:02:47,848 --> 00:02:54,328
loved him<font color="#E5E5E5"> for his achievements that's a</font>

63
00:02:49,650 --> 00:02:56,459
very<font color="#E5E5E5"> intellectual concept but also there</font>

64
00:02:54,329 --> 00:03:00,049
are warm feelings towards him that come

65
00:02:56,459 --> 00:03:04,430
from the center of<font color="#E5E5E5"> your body your heart</font>

66
00:03:00,049 --> 00:03:07,409
you need is<font color="#E5E5E5"> very interesting oftentimes</font>

67
00:03:04,430 --> 00:03:12,450
attraction by mind will warm up the

68
00:03:07,408 --> 00:03:15,449
heart but<font color="#E5E5E5"> ultimately it has to sink</font>

69
00:03:12,449 --> 00:03:18,060
deeper and that's when we get into

70
00:03:15,449 --> 00:03:19,108
sexual union a lot of times it starts

71
00:03:18,060 --> 00:03:21,000
with the sexual<font color="#CCCCCC"> union it's interesting</font>

72
00:03:19,109 --> 00:03:23,430
how in balance we become in our love to

73
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:25,109
one another it starts with boy<font color="#CCCCCC"> by dicks</font>

74
00:03:23,430 --> 00:03:26,969

82

the animality the sexuality of

88
00:03:55,919 --> 00:04:01,129
individual but no heart for women

89
00:03:58,620 --> 00:04:05,819
<font color="#E5E5E5">sometimes it's all heart and no head I</font>

90
00:04:01,128 --> 00:04:07,229
love him for whatever deep reason a lot

experiences what night I love him but

93
00:04:09,449 --> 00:04:15,000
he's an idiot he's stupid my brain is

94
00:04:12,239 --> 00:04:18,658
saying it's a bad idea because he has no

95
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:20,579
job<font color="#E5E5E5"> he's on drugs and his he beat up his</font>

96
00:04:18,658 --> 00:04:24,810
last girlfriend right sometimes women

97
00:04:20,579 --> 00:04:26,759
are drawn with the heart then with the

98
00:04:24,810 --> 00:04:30,370
head

99
00:04:26,759 --> 00:04:34,658
and then<font color="#CCCCCC"> again the sexuality do I want</font>

100
00:04:30,370 --> 00:04:36,759
to<font color="#CCCCCC"> open up to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> him so what you're asking</font>

101
00:04:34,658 --> 00:04:40,149
now is can we can we<font color="#E5E5E5"> develop a</font>

102
00:04:36,759 --> 00:04:42,460
relationship with in absence of lust and

103
00:04:40,149 --> 00:04:45,758
you use that<font color="#CCCCCC"> word lust but</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I wouldn't</font>

104
00:04:42,459 --> 00:04:49,778
call it just lust lust is an imbalanced

105
00:04:45,759 --> 00:04:52,569
form of<font color="#E5E5E5"> attraction lust means it's it's</font>

106
00:04:49,778 --> 00:04:59,339
all dick no heart or all vagina no heart

107
00:04:52,569 --> 00:05:01,509
no head what you're<font color="#CCCCCC"> really asking is</font>

108
00:04:59,339 --> 00:05:05,348
could we have a deep meaningful

109
00:05:01,509 --> 00:05:09,550
relationship without deep meaningful

110
00:05:05,348 --> 00:05:11,139
sexual<font color="#E5E5E5"> union I don't think</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it's</font>

111
00:05:09,550 --> 00:05:13,478
necessary in your case I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think what</font>

112
00:05:11,139 --> 00:05:16,210
happens is a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of times when there are</font>

113
00:05:13,478 --> 00:05:18,938
individuals who are contracted<font color="#E5E5E5"> in there</font>

114
00:05:16,209 --> 00:05:21,549
the lower portion of<font color="#E5E5E5"> their bodies come</font>

115
00:05:18,939 --> 00:05:25,778
together by<font color="#CCCCCC"> hearten and head but chant</font>

116
00:05:21,550 --> 00:05:28,930
have very they're very uncomfortable

117
00:05:25,778 --> 00:05:30,639
sexually<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's because of neurotic</font>

118
00:05:28,930 --> 00:05:31,990
holding patterns it's because<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the</font>

119
00:05:30,639 --> 00:05:34,509
inability<font color="#E5E5E5"> to breathe into your balls</font>

120
00:05:31,990 --> 00:05:38,408
it's because of muscular restrictions in

121
00:05:34,509 --> 00:05:43,060
your pelvic floor down in what would be

122

well and a lot of us we live this world

124
00:05:45,819 --> 00:05:50,080
we live this castrated way in our world

125
00:05:48,310 --> 00:05:54,668
because we have been<font color="#CCCCCC"> taught that our</font>

126
00:05:50,079 --> 00:05:57,278
sexuality is naughty and it robs us of

127
00:05:54,668 --> 00:05:58,718
our deepest most intimate opportunities

128
00:05:57,278 --> 00:06:04,079
that we could have with<font color="#E5E5E5"> people that we</font>

129
00:05:58,718 --> 00:06:04,079
would perhaps love in three ways

00:06:06,290 --> 00:06:14,750
so my invitation<font color="#CCCCCC"> to you my friend my</font>

lady friend as you use your intellect to

132
00:06:14,750 --> 00:06:22,199
further deepen the bonds of

133
00:06:18,410 --> 00:06:24,240
understanding with this man and your

134
00:06:22,199 --> 00:06:27,389
<font color="#CCCCCC">hearts warm to one another but yet</font>

135
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:28,470
<font color="#E5E5E5">there's constricted sexuality number one</font>

136
00:06:27,389 --> 00:06:32,969
realized that it doesn't have to stay

137
00:06:28,470 --> 00:06:34,680
that way now he was born as a if<font color="#E5E5E5"> he was</font>

each other from this portion only look

142
00:06:40,350 --> 00:06:44,070
that's that's a totally different story

00:06:41,790 --> 00:06:46,170
<font color="#E5E5E5">please develop develop the amount of</font>

fucked up sexually we're all fucked up

221
00:09:55,700 --> 00:09:59,680
in our hearts and in our heads it's a

222
00:09:57,500 --> 00:10:02,110
neurotic society that we were born in

223
00:09:59,679 --> 00:10:04,819
civilization has damaged the physical

224
00:10:02,110 --> 00:10:06,350
integrity of the human being on multiple

225
00:10:04,820 --> 00:10:08,570

it practically open up your sexual

229
00:10:15,230 --> 00:10:20,149
energy or so we're so grossed out by

230
00:10:18,379 --> 00:10:23,028
that area<font color="#CCCCCC"> of our bodies we think we're</font>

231
00:10:20,149 --> 00:10:25,458
<font color="#E5E5E5">you're really sexually liberal but we're</font>

not we're still very sexually

233
00:10:25,458 --> 00:10:30,409
conservative and that word even is it

234
00:10:28,070 --> 00:10:32,700
doesn't give justice we're perverted

235
00:10:30,409 --> 00:10:35,219
sexually<font color="#E5E5E5"> and the way we look at each</font>

238
00:10:42,330 --> 00:10:46,470
each other if you love each other

239
00:10:43,500 --> 00:10:48,750
explore this with each other but

240
00:10:46,470 --> 00:10:50,430
understand that<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's incomplete</font>

241
00:10:48,750 --> 00:10:52,409
especially if it's available it's

242

incomplete your love<font color="#CCCCCC"> will be incomplete</font>
