where I left off yesterday yesterday we

4
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:10,500
were talking about<font color="#E5E5E5"> the development of</font>

5
00:00:07,469 --> 00:00:12,089
new habits and rituals<font color="#E5E5E5"> to support you in</font>

10
00:00:18,300 --> 00:00:26,099
becoming a stronger you it was helping

11
00:00:21,329 --> 00:00:28,320
fitness career and addition you know

12
00:00:26,099 --> 00:00:30,480
eradicate addiction and filling the hole

13
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:33,469
with something more resourceful but as I

14
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:37,049
read<font color="#CCCCCC"> it on yesterday I forgot to mention</font>

15
00:00:33,469 --> 00:00:39,058
career or vocation so today we'll pick

16
00:00:37,049 --> 00:00:42,569
up very quickly before I get into

17
00:00:39,058 --> 00:00:44,399
today's main message by talking about

18
00:00:42,570 --> 00:00:46,170
<font color="#E5E5E5">three different habits that would</font>

19
00:00:44,399 --> 00:00:49,379
support you in the development of your

20
00:00:46,170 --> 00:00:51,329
career vocation or job if you have<font color="#E5E5E5"> one</font>

21
00:00:49,378 --> 00:00:56,039
so I'll actually split it up that way

22
00:00:51,329 --> 00:00:58,620
those who are in your own<font color="#E5E5E5"> business or in</font>

23
00:00:56,039 --> 00:01:00,840
sales if you're an entrepreneur or if

24
00:00:58,619 --> 00:01:02,669
you're in sales the three things that

25
00:01:00,840 --> 00:01:05,900
<font color="#E5E5E5">you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know right whether you're building</font>

26
00:01:02,670 --> 00:01:08,640
your own<font color="#E5E5E5"> business or you're selling</font>

27
00:01:05,900 --> 00:01:11,510
titanium screws like a friend of mine

28
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:16,228
does he sells titanium screws in the

29
00:01:11,510 --> 00:01:18,210
medical industry knee kills it so if I

30
00:01:16,228 --> 00:01:19,409
didn't personally<font color="#E5E5E5"> if I didn't own my own</font>

31
00:01:18,209 --> 00:01:21,029
business what I would do is I probably

32
00:01:19,409 --> 00:01:23,820
<font color="#E5E5E5">go into sales if I you know if I were to</font>

33
00:01:21,030 --> 00:01:27,810
get a job because it requires a little

34
00:01:23,819 --> 00:01:29,089
bit of a courageousness bravery and you

35
00:01:27,810 --> 00:01:31,379
know it's either a<font color="#CCCCCC"> sink-or-swim</font>

36
00:01:29,090 --> 00:01:33,329
situation when you work<font color="#CCCCCC"> for yourself or</font>

37
00:01:31,379 --> 00:01:36,390
in sales and<font color="#CCCCCC"> the three things that</font>

38
00:01:33,328 --> 00:01:40,169
matter most when you're developing your

39
00:01:36,390 --> 00:01:42,299

<font color="#E5E5E5">post from earlier this morning where I</font>

109
00:04:20,680 --> 00:04:23,280
talk about

110
00:04:23,329 --> 00:04:32,389
getting very clear on our true root the

111
00:04:28,819 --> 00:04:34,729
real<font color="#E5E5E5"> reason why we pursue the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> things we</font>

112
00:04:32,389 --> 00:04:38,509
pursue so in my blog post<font color="#E5E5E5"> I talked about</font>

113
00:04:34,728 --> 00:04:42,218
<font color="#CCCCCC">when I was pursuing strong man accolades</font>

114
00:04:38,509 --> 00:04:44,840
right between the<font color="#CCCCCC"> eight between</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> 2006 and</font>

115
00:04:42,218 --> 00:04:47,629
2010 I was<font color="#E5E5E5"> heavily involved in strongman</font>

116
00:04:44,839 --> 00:04:51,138
competitions I was winning and I was

117
00:04:47,629 --> 00:04:54,710
getting trophies I have lots of trophies

118
00:04:51,139 --> 00:04:56,509
dozens of trophies and plaques the thing

119
00:04:54,709 --> 00:04:59,560
is<font color="#E5E5E5"> with all those trophies and plaques</font>

120
00:04:56,509 --> 00:05:03,889
is that they're in a box somewhere in

121
00:04:59,560 --> 00:05:05,709
storage what because I have come to

122
00:05:03,889 --> 00:05:08,478
realize you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know it's taken some time</font>

123
00:05:05,709 --> 00:05:10,158
really a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot of these</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> things aren't</font>

124
00:05:08,478 --> 00:05:12,019
judgments and we<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't choose them</font>

125
00:05:10,158 --> 00:05:15,348
there's self observations and one of my

126
00:05:12,019 --> 00:05:19,008
self observations has been that<font color="#CCCCCC"> I really</font>

127
00:05:15,348 --> 00:05:22,550
could care less for trophies and gifts

128
00:05:19,009 --> 00:05:23,870
and prizes what I really thrive on again

129
00:05:22,550 --> 00:05:27,620
it's not<font color="#E5E5E5"> a judgment it's just an</font>

130
00:05:23,870 --> 00:05:29,629
observation<font color="#E5E5E5"> our words of affirmation man</font>

131
00:05:27,620 --> 00:05:33,050
every<font color="#CCCCCC"> time I want a straw man show and</font>

00:05:29,629 --> 00:05:35,060
my coach or my or my dad or my wife or

133
00:05:33,050 --> 00:05:37,728
my friends put their hand on my<font color="#E5E5E5"> back</font>

134
00:05:35,060 --> 00:05:40,848
gave me a hug so you did a great job I'm

135
00:05:37,728 --> 00:05:44,258
proud of<font color="#E5E5E5"> you Elliott that just rose in</font>

136
00:05:40,848 --> 00:05:47,658
me but my heart swelled and I was

137
00:05:44,259 --> 00:05:49,490
overjoyed by simply having those words

138
00:05:47,658 --> 00:05:51,588
of affirmations a pat on the back of hug

139
00:05:49,490 --> 00:05:53,329
my wife looks into my eyes and says I'm

140
00:05:51,588 --> 00:05:56,149
proud of you well that does it for me

141
00:05:53,329 --> 00:05:58,668
more than<font color="#E5E5E5"> anything so that's me being</font>

142
00:05:56,149 --> 00:06:02,388
very clear on what I'm pursuing in a way

143
00:05:58,668 --> 00:06:05,598
you could say that's in a way you can

144
