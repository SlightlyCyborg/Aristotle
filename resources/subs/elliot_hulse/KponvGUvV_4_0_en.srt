00:00:00,920 --> 00:00:04,528
so lately I've been getting a lot of

2
00:00:02,819 --> 00:00:06,990
questions from parents wanting to know

3
00:00:04,528 --> 00:00:09,210
what<font color="#CCCCCC"> Elliot thinks about raising</font>

4
00:00:06,990 --> 00:00:11,009
<font color="#CCCCCC">children which is a little awkward but</font>

5
00:00:09,210 --> 00:00:14,160
considering<font color="#E5E5E5"> the fact that I have four</font>

6
00:00:11,009 --> 00:00:16,528
<font color="#CCCCCC">children and I share my thoughts and</font>

7
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:18,899
wisdom with you on a daily basis I can

8
00:00:16,528 --> 00:00:20,309
see<font color="#E5E5E5"> why the questions came in so before</font>

9
00:00:18,899 --> 00:00:22,259
<font color="#CCCCCC">I get started the very first thing i</font>

10
00:00:20,309 --> 00:00:24,179
want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to offer is that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i am not a</font>

11
00:00:22,260 --> 00:00:26,130
parenting expert you probably know that

12
00:00:24,179 --> 00:00:28,559
the thing is<font color="#CCCCCC"> i don't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> think there's such</font>

13
00:00:26,129 --> 00:00:30,149
a thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> as a parenting expert simply</font>

14
00:00:28,559 --> 00:00:31,919
<font color="#CCCCCC">because everyone is going to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> have</font>

15
00:00:30,149 --> 00:00:34,859
<font color="#E5E5E5">totally different experiences with</font>

16
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:36,420
regard to raising children anyone tells

17
00:00:34,859 --> 00:00:38,100
you that they've<font color="#E5E5E5"> got all the tactics and</font>

18
00:00:36,420 --> 00:00:40,920
strategies that<font color="#CCCCCC"> you need to be</font>

19
00:00:38,100 --> 00:00:42,510
<font color="#CCCCCC">successful in anything and completely</font>

20
00:00:40,920 --> 00:00:47,820

<font color="#E5E5E5">thing they're lying to you right so let</font>

23
00:00:50,340 --> 00:00:55,890
started<font color="#E5E5E5"> working with a mentor who also</font>

24
00:00:52,109 --> 00:00:57,359
happens to be a psycho analysts he's a

27
00:00:59,579 --> 00:01:06,000
session I broke down<font color="#CCCCCC"> into tears and the</font>

28
00:01:03,420 --> 00:01:07,920
the reason<font color="#CCCCCC"> why was because of guilt that</font>

29
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:12,180
I had from an experienced earlier in the

30
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:14,250
day I my daughter was behaving badly or

31
00:01:12,180 --> 00:01:17,580
poorly or just not up to what I expected

32
00:01:14,250 --> 00:01:19,200
<font color="#E5E5E5">of her that morning and instead of</font>

33
00:01:17,579 --> 00:01:21,359
saying anything<font color="#CCCCCC"> I went took something</font>

34
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:23,850
that was very important to her I stuffed

35
00:01:21,359 --> 00:01:26,219
it in the garbage can talk about<font color="#E5E5E5"> being a</font>

36
00:01:23,849 --> 00:01:27,750
bad parent right taking stuffed in the

37
00:01:26,219 --> 00:01:30,298
garbage can<font color="#CCCCCC"> I was like when you start to</font>

38
00:01:27,750 --> 00:01:32,819
behave kindly to your sisters I think

39
00:01:30,299 --> 00:01:34,470
she was just<font color="#E5E5E5"> being mean then you can</font>

40
00:01:32,819 --> 00:01:36,239
have this thing back now the garbage can

41
00:01:34,469 --> 00:01:38,750
was empty so wasn't sullied or anything

42
00:01:36,239 --> 00:01:41,789
like that and but she was really upset

43
00:01:38,750 --> 00:01:44,129
distraught that Daddy stuffed her thing

44
00:01:41,790 --> 00:01:46,590
in the garbage can<font color="#E5E5E5"> and you know we went</font>

45
00:01:44,129 --> 00:01:48,688
about our<font color="#E5E5E5"> day we made up and the</font>

46
00:01:46,590 --> 00:01:50,100
feelings associated with that<font color="#E5E5E5"> experience</font>

47
00:01:48,688 --> 00:01:51,989
most of stuck with me because later on

48
00:01:50,099 --> 00:01:54,868
that day when I went and<font color="#E5E5E5"> saw my mentor I</font>

49
00:01:51,989 --> 00:01:56,489
broke<font color="#CCCCCC"> down in tears feelings</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of guilt</font>

50
00:01:54,868 --> 00:01:59,399
about you know being a horrible parent

51
00:01:56,489 --> 00:02:02,129
and how I could possibly ever raise

52
00:01:59,399 --> 00:02:03,989
healthy smart intelligent creative

53
00:02:02,129 --> 00:02:06,319
children from stuffing their shit in the

54
00:02:03,989 --> 00:02:07,879
garbage right

55
00:02:06,319 --> 00:02:12,169
and he said<font color="#E5E5E5"> something to me that was</font>

56
00:02:07,879 --> 00:02:14,870
very profound he said the most important

57
00:02:12,169 --> 00:02:19,579
thing that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can do</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Elliot to ensure</font>

58
00:02:14,870 --> 00:02:24,830
<font color="#CCCCCC">that you are a good parent is to work on</font>

59
00:02:19,580 --> 00:02:26,750
yourself first<font color="#E5E5E5"> and clearly you're doing</font>

60
00:02:24,830 --> 00:02:28,280
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> so you affirm that you know I'm</font>

61
00:02:26,750 --> 00:02:30,889
<font color="#CCCCCC">doing all right and it got me</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> thinking</font>

62
00:02:28,280 --> 00:02:32,360
<font color="#CCCCCC">about phrase that I constantly repeat</font>

63
00:02:30,889 --> 00:02:35,329
over and over again because I believe so

64
00:02:32,360 --> 00:02:37,400
strongly in it that it doesn't matter

65
00:02:35,330 --> 00:02:39,260
what you do<font color="#CCCCCC"> the tactics and techniques</font>

66
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:40,969
and the books<font color="#CCCCCC"> that you read and what</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

67
00:02:39,259 --> 00:02:43,819
mechanically do with your hands doesn't

68
00:02:40,969 --> 00:02:47,270
<font color="#E5E5E5">matter nearly as much as the sentiment</font>

69
00:02:43,819 --> 00:02:51,109
from which it proceeds who you are means

70
00:02:47,270 --> 00:02:54,260
far more<font color="#E5E5E5"> than what you do with regard to</font>

71
00:02:51,110 --> 00:02:56,800
being a parent so like I described in

72
00:02:54,259 --> 00:02:59,479
other videos<font color="#CCCCCC"> you can have</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> two people</font>

73
00:02:56,800 --> 00:03:01,450
doing the same exact thing two hands

74
00:02:59,479 --> 00:03:05,750
performing the same exact actions

75
00:03:01,449 --> 00:03:09,049
seemingly identical and get to-- two

76
00:03:05,750 --> 00:03:10,789
totally different results and<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's why</font>

77
00:03:09,050 --> 00:03:13,519
anybody who offers you the tactics and

78
00:03:10,789 --> 00:03:15,530
strategies for success is lying to<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

79
00:03:13,519 --> 00:03:17,659
they can give you their ideas they can

80
00:03:15,530 --> 00:03:19,489
give you their experiences they can

81
00:03:17,659 --> 00:03:21,199
share you with you some wisdom that

82
00:03:19,489 --> 00:03:22,579
they've gained through the years of

83
00:03:21,199 --> 00:03:25,399
doing the thing that you'd<font color="#CCCCCC"> like to do</font>

84
00:03:22,579 --> 00:03:28,909
better<font color="#CCCCCC"> they can't tell you exactly what</font>

85
00:03:25,400 --> 00:03:31,730
to do because who you<font color="#CCCCCC"> are</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is going to</font>

86
00:03:28,909 --> 00:03:34,879
pervade it's going to color all of the

87
00:03:31,729 --> 00:03:37,399
tactics and strategies that<font color="#CCCCCC"> you act out</font>

88
00:03:34,879 --> 00:03:40,099
the emotion<font color="#CCCCCC"> that you carry your self</font>

89
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:42,219
esteem the years and<font color="#E5E5E5"> years and</font>

90
00:03:40,099 --> 00:03:44,689
generations and generations of

91
00:03:42,219 --> 00:03:48,709
conditioning that you carry within your

92
00:03:44,689 --> 00:03:51,469
mind and soul is going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> color all of</font>

93
00:03:48,709 --> 00:03:54,680
your activities so with regard to being

94
00:03:51,469 --> 00:03:56,389
a parent I'm not telling<font color="#CCCCCC"> you to stuff</font>

95
00:03:54,680 --> 00:03:59,090
your children's things in the garbage

96
00:03:56,389 --> 00:04:03,679
like I<font color="#CCCCCC"> have but take a step back and not</font>

97
00:03:59,090 --> 00:04:06,590
don't be so connected and focused<font color="#E5E5E5"> on</font>

98
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:07,670
what you're actually doing and think

99
00:04:06,590 --> 00:04:09,229
about where it's coming from are<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

100
00:04:07,669 --> 00:04:11,349
coming<font color="#E5E5E5"> from a place of love for you</font>

101
00:04:09,229 --> 00:04:14,000
coming from<font color="#E5E5E5"> a place of generosity of</font>

102
00:04:11,349 --> 00:04:16,250
appreciation for life or you coming from

103
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:17,639
a place of anger frustration I know

104
00:04:16,250 --> 00:04:20,279
early on in my parents

105
00:04:17,639 --> 00:04:22,288
career a lot of what<font color="#E5E5E5"> I did was just a</font>

106
00:04:20,279 --> 00:04:25,109
invitation of what my parents did I

107
00:04:22,288 --> 00:04:27,300
would say things and behave in ways and

108
00:04:25,110 --> 00:04:30,240
yell and scream the same way my dad did

109
00:04:27,300 --> 00:04:32,129
to me and it wasn't<font color="#CCCCCC"> because I thought</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font>

110
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:33,629
<font color="#E5E5E5">was the right thing to do was because</font>

111
00:04:32,129 --> 00:04:35,819
that's what I was conditioned to do and

112
00:04:33,629 --> 00:04:39,509
he probably just did what his dad told

113
00:04:35,819 --> 00:04:42,210
him and doing or or did to him without

114
00:04:39,509 --> 00:04:44,129
having to think about too much so

115
00:04:42,209 --> 00:04:47,370
without thinking I was talking to<font color="#E5E5E5"> my</font>

116
00:04:44,129 --> 00:04:48,840
daughter and daughters the way that my

117
00:04:47,370 --> 00:04:50,459
parents spoke to me and<font color="#E5E5E5"> then when i took</font>

118
00:04:48,839 --> 00:04:52,560
conscious control of<font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i realized that</font>

119
00:04:50,459 --> 00:04:56,250
this is not who I am that Hawaii wanted

120
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:59,519
be and I'm going to continue<font color="#CCCCCC"> to proceed</font>

121
00:04:56,250 --> 00:05:01,649
from a different place place of empathy

122
00:04:59,519 --> 00:05:02,818
which is really where I come from most

123
00:05:01,649 --> 00:05:04,739
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the time when I'm dealing with my</font>

124
00:05:02,819 --> 00:05:07,949
children when I say empathy I

125
00:05:04,740 --> 00:05:11,218
essentially<font color="#E5E5E5"> mean that I feel what they</font>

126
00:05:07,949 --> 00:05:13,889
feel living<font color="#CCCCCC"> in a world where everyone's</font>

127
00:05:11,218 --> 00:05:16,528
trying to control you squash you stop

128
00:05:13,889 --> 00:05:20,218
you from being who your heart's desire

129
00:05:16,528 --> 00:05:22,918
is for you I need to guide and control

130
00:05:20,218 --> 00:05:25,949
them in<font color="#CCCCCC"> certain ways so they don't get</font>

131
00:05:22,918 --> 00:05:28,528
hurt but beyond that hurting themselves

132
00:05:25,949 --> 00:05:31,740
or hurting other people I try to have a

133
00:05:28,528 --> 00:05:33,569
very little or minimal hand in and

134
00:05:31,740 --> 00:05:37,288
guiding and controlling their behavior

135
00:05:33,569 --> 00:05:40,139
this comes from my heart this is who I

136
00:05:37,288 --> 00:05:42,300
am and it's not so much what I do I hope

137
00:05:40,139 --> 00:05:44,478
<font color="#E5E5E5">this is helpful for you talk to you next</font>

138
00:05:42,300 --> 00:05:44,478
time
