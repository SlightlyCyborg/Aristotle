00:02:12,370 --> 00:02:16,700
personal trainers of<font color="#CCCCCC"> waiting is emits a</font>

47
00:02:14,599 --> 00:02:18,549
funny position because you really want

to<font color="#E5E5E5"> change your healing people's souls</font>

49
00:02:18,550 --> 00:02:22,969
touch people what their hearts they're

00:02:21,080 --> 00:02:24,740
<font color="#E5E5E5">asking you to do it that's why they come</font>

52
00:02:24,740 --> 00:02:29,810
mothers and their husbands and I've

touch people with my words

56
00:02:34,430 --> 00:02:42,859
then ideas and words might be

57
00:02:36,169 --> 00:02:45,438
transformative answer but it was like

58
00:02:42,859 --> 00:02:47,150
