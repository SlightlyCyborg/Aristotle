yo<font color="#CCCCCC"> Elliott hey whats up guys today we</font>

2
00:00:09,570 --> 00:00:13,230
<font color="#E5E5E5">got a question from our shred camp</font>

3
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:16,830
online member<font color="#CCCCCC"> Joshua Dickinson he says</font>

4
00:00:13,230 --> 00:00:20,339
that I'm currently attempting a career

5
00:00:16,829 --> 00:00:22,349
in law enforcement at some level whether

6
00:00:20,339 --> 00:00:24,420
that be federal state or local policing

7
00:00:22,350 --> 00:00:26,368
<font color="#CCCCCC">anyway to move</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> along in the process he</font>

8
00:00:24,420 --> 00:00:28,980
<font color="#E5E5E5">needs to be able to pass physical</font>

9
00:00:26,368 --> 00:00:30,839
fitness test and he trains his ass off

10
00:00:28,980 --> 00:00:34,109
he says that uh you know he can do

11
00:00:30,839 --> 00:00:36,780
push-ups around 30 to 40 in a minute sit

12
00:00:34,109 --> 00:00:39,269
ups 35 to 45 in a minute he can run the

13
00:00:36,780 --> 00:00:41,070
one and a half mile run he doesnt sit

14
00:00:39,270 --> 00:00:43,440
and reach<font color="#E5E5E5"> body weight he does really</font>

15
00:00:41,070 --> 00:00:46,049
well in his training<font color="#E5E5E5"> he practices and he</font>

16
00:00:43,439 --> 00:00:49,199
can pass all the tests when he's at home

17
00:00:46,049 --> 00:00:52,979
or in his gym but the<font color="#CCCCCC"> problem is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> when it</font>

18
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:55,680
comes time to do the actual test for

19
00:00:52,979 --> 00:00:58,229
whatever he's attempting to<font color="#E5E5E5"> potentially</font>

20
00:00:55,679 --> 00:01:01,679
be a part of d falls short in other

21
00:00:58,229 --> 00:01:03,269
words you choked buddy right so there

22
00:01:01,679 --> 00:01:05,368
you are spending all of your time energy

23
00:01:03,270 --> 00:01:07,320
and effort to build up your strength and

24
00:01:05,368 --> 00:01:09,030
your ability in these<font color="#E5E5E5"> particular tests</font>

25
00:01:07,319 --> 00:01:11,009
and then when the<font color="#CCCCCC"> ten you do well</font>

26
00:01:09,030 --> 00:01:15,890
practice right you're a winner in

27
00:01:11,010 --> 00:01:20,420
practice but<font color="#E5E5E5"> then when game time comes</font>

28
00:01:15,890 --> 00:01:23,329
you choked up right so uh you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know</font>

29
00:01:20,420 --> 00:01:25,590
language the way somebody says something

30
00:01:23,329 --> 00:01:28,679
tells you a lot about their state<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

31
00:01:25,590 --> 00:01:30,780
<font color="#CCCCCC">mind and as I'm reading your question</font>

32
00:01:28,680 --> 00:01:34,500
and you begin with you're currently

33
00:01:30,780 --> 00:01:37,320
attempting to start<font color="#E5E5E5"> a career it in law</font>

34
00:01:34,500 --> 00:01:39,900
enforcement at some level it essentially

35
00:01:37,319 --> 00:01:42,809
<font color="#E5E5E5">it says to me</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that you're really</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> not</font>

36
00:01:39,900 --> 00:01:44,759
committed<font color="#E5E5E5"> to anything you want to</font>

37
00:01:42,810 --> 00:01:47,280
attempt you<font color="#E5E5E5"> see</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> hurry what you're really</font>

38
00:01:44,759 --> 00:01:48,359
<font color="#CCCCCC">committed</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to is attempting right and</font>

39
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:50,549
that's what you do it<font color="#E5E5E5"> like when you show</font>

40
00:01:48,359 --> 00:01:52,290
up<font color="#CCCCCC"> for the test you've committed to</font>

41
00:01:50,549 --> 00:01:55,470
attempting and now you're attempting

42
00:01:52,290 --> 00:01:57,719
you're not committed<font color="#CCCCCC"> to winning right</font>

43
00:01:55,469 --> 00:02:03,840
you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> not committed</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to passing the test</font>

44
00:01:57,718 --> 00:02:05,669
you're committed to trying it out and it

45
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:07,290
kind of reminds me of when I<font color="#CCCCCC"> was</font>

46
00:02:05,670 --> 00:02:09,360
competing in<font color="#E5E5E5"> straw man and what some of</font>

47
00:02:07,290 --> 00:02:10,610
the guys I would train with were a lot

48
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:13,970
stronger than<font color="#E5E5E5"> me</font>

49
00:02:10,610 --> 00:02:16,340
and in practice they really would<font color="#CCCCCC"> whoop</font>

50
00:02:13,969 --> 00:02:18,530
my<font color="#CCCCCC"> ass I mean they're lifting stones and</font>

51
00:02:16,340 --> 00:02:22,659
flipping tires and doing weights that I

52
00:02:18,530 --> 00:02:27,650
could<font color="#CCCCCC"> not even</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> touch but when it came</font>

53
00:02:22,659 --> 00:02:29,389
competition time i won I always want in

54
00:02:27,650 --> 00:02:33,230
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> competitions but they always kick my</font>

55
00:02:29,389 --> 00:02:35,649
ass<font color="#E5E5E5"> in practice why is that because when</font>

56
00:02:33,229 --> 00:02:39,109
they went into the show they were

57
00:02:35,650 --> 00:02:42,740
attempting to win when I went into the

58
00:02:39,110 --> 00:02:44,690
show I was committed to<font color="#CCCCCC"> winning what you</font>

59
00:02:42,740 --> 00:02:46,640
need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to understand is that language that</font>

60
00:02:44,689 --> 00:02:48,169
you're using is a manifestation of the

61
00:02:46,639 --> 00:02:50,389
way you're thinking<font color="#E5E5E5"> about yourself in</font>

62
00:02:48,169 --> 00:02:54,859
<font color="#E5E5E5">the circumstance I don't attempt</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to win</font>

63
00:02:50,389 --> 00:02:57,199
I go to win understand so what that

64
00:02:54,860 --> 00:03:00,470
means is and what it requires is that

65
00:02:57,199 --> 00:03:03,589
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> spend some</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> time</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> really visualizing</font>

66
00:03:00,469 --> 00:03:05,629
and feeling and knowing<font color="#CCCCCC"> that you're</font>

67
00:03:03,590 --> 00:03:08,239
going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to pass the test it's a no-brainer</font>

68
00:03:05,629 --> 00:03:09,560
when you walk into that test knowing

69
00:03:08,239 --> 00:03:12,890
especially that you've done well in

70
00:03:09,560 --> 00:03:16,009
practice you are going to pass see it

71
00:03:12,889 --> 00:03:17,539
feel it know it be cocky about it right

72
00:03:16,009 --> 00:03:19,370
<font color="#E5E5E5">because even if I'm getting my ass</font>

73
00:03:17,539 --> 00:03:21,319
<font color="#CCCCCC">whooped</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> in practice because hey you guys</font>

74
00:03:19,370 --> 00:03:24,500
are stronger than me that's fine<font color="#CCCCCC"> but</font>

75
00:03:21,319 --> 00:03:27,349
guess what I'm a<font color="#E5E5E5"> winner you ain't gonna</font>

76
00:03:24,500 --> 00:03:30,650
beat me well all the numbers say no

77
00:03:27,349 --> 00:03:32,900
matter it's the attitude man so you got

78
00:03:30,650 --> 00:03:35,539
to go<font color="#E5E5E5"> into this thing not attempting and</font>

79
00:03:32,900 --> 00:03:39,590
and you know you mentioned at some level

80
00:03:35,539 --> 00:03:43,239
no no no exactly what you're going into

81
00:03:39,590 --> 00:03:46,340
exit at exactly what level right I mean

82
00:03:43,239 --> 00:03:48,849
spell it out for yourself visualize it

83
00:03:46,340 --> 00:03:53,560
right up until the end I'm going<font color="#E5E5E5"> into</font>

84
00:03:48,849 --> 00:03:59,180
this branch of the Armed Forces or a

85
00:03:53,560 --> 00:04:01,330
policeman force at this level and I'm

86
00:03:59,180 --> 00:04:06,409
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to pass the test on this day and</font>

87
00:04:01,330 --> 00:04:06,850
it's as good as done done<font color="#CCCCCC"> Elliot's it</font>

88
00:04:06,409 --> 00:04:16,199
what
