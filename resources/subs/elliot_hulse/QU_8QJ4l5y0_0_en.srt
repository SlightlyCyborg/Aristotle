2
00:00:04,318 --> 00:00:08,969
<font color="#CCCCCC">post</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> one of my real controversial ideas</font>

3
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:11,580
with regard to sexuality on my facebook

4
00:00:08,970 --> 00:00:13,679
wall and it turned into a train wreck

5
00:00:11,580 --> 00:00:15,870
and if you go there now you'll<font color="#CCCCCC"> see that</font>

6
00:00:13,679 --> 00:00:18,539
the dust is still settling I also wrote

7
00:00:15,869 --> 00:00:21,600
a blog post clarifying my idea on what

8
00:00:18,539 --> 00:00:23,789
sexuality actually means and offering a

9
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:26,310
counter<font color="#CCCCCC"> to what popular culture and</font>

10
00:00:23,789 --> 00:00:29,118
media calls sexy by posting<font color="#CCCCCC"> a picture</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

11
00:00:26,309 --> 00:00:32,250
a woman who clearly was photoshopped but

12
00:00:29,118 --> 00:00:36,840
nonetheless represents what the modern

13
00:00:32,250 --> 00:00:39,750
mind thinks of as sexy so you can go<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

14
00:00:36,840 --> 00:00:41,910
take a look<font color="#E5E5E5"> at that as the dust has been</font>

15
00:00:39,750 --> 00:00:47,128
settling people are asking<font color="#CCCCCC"> me questions</font>

16
00:00:41,909 --> 00:00:49,558
about<font color="#E5E5E5"> what I think is is a way for us to</font>

17
00:00:47,128 --> 00:00:51,808
access<font color="#E5E5E5"> what I'm calling true sexuality</font>

18
00:00:49,558 --> 00:00:53,609
in this blog post if I can explain it

19
00:00:51,808 --> 00:00:55,948
<font color="#CCCCCC">all here to you now I'm going to have</font>

20
00:00:53,609 --> 00:00:58,979
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> read the blog post but I'm</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> gonna</font>

21
00:00:55,948 --> 00:01:01,890
offer a idea cuz that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> all this is to</font>

22
00:00:58,979 --> 00:01:05,338
your folks that's all this is is

23
00:01:01,890 --> 00:01:06,989
Elliot's ideas take it or leave it if

24
00:01:05,338 --> 00:01:09,000
it's interesting and<font color="#E5E5E5"> resourceful to you</font>

25
00:01:06,989 --> 00:01:14,339
use it if it makes you uncomfortable

26
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:16,469
then just turn it off that being said<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

27
00:01:14,340 --> 00:01:18,469
you know the train wreck created such a

28
00:01:16,469 --> 00:01:21,840
turmoil that people were name-calling

29
00:01:18,469 --> 00:01:24,269
here for the<font color="#E5E5E5"> tenth time look I enjoy</font>

30
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:26,969
debate I enjoy sharing ideas with you I

31
00:01:24,269 --> 00:01:29,399
enjoy if you challenge my ideas because

32
00:01:26,969 --> 00:01:31,560
it keeps me sharp well when you resort

33
00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:34,530
to name-calling it's an automatic lose

34
00:01:31,560 --> 00:01:37,019
and you're banned sorry I<font color="#E5E5E5"> just won't put</font>

35
00:01:34,530 --> 00:01:38,879
up with name-calling ok it's just<font color="#E5E5E5"> my</font>

36
00:01:37,019 --> 00:01:40,200
rule so anyway the question that keep

37
00:01:38,879 --> 00:01:42,989
getting ass is<font color="#CCCCCC"> Elliot how do we access</font>

38
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:47,030
our sexuality get to the<font color="#CCCCCC"> point</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and the</font>

39
00:01:42,989 --> 00:01:50,250
way we do that is through deep breathing

40
00:01:47,030 --> 00:01:52,320
accessing our body through deep

41
00:01:50,250 --> 00:01:55,618
breathing the problem is that we've

42
00:01:52,319 --> 00:01:58,289
become so tense there's so much muscular

43
00:01:55,618 --> 00:02:01,680
armor in our neck in our chest or

44
00:01:58,290 --> 00:02:04,860
stomach and our pelvic wall pelvic Basin

45
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:10,890
that we can't breathe deep there's the

46
00:02:04,859 --> 00:02:13,409
ability to bring in the nourishing life

47
00:02:10,889 --> 00:02:16,349
force through the air that<font color="#CCCCCC"> we breathe in</font>

breathe through the open mouth when you

78
00:03:29,849 --> 00:03:34,409
do this you're essentially a long gating

79
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:37,290
and stretching out all those extra

80
00:03:34,409 --> 00:03:39,240
respiratory muscles you're opening your

81

mouth which relaxes the muscles that

82
00:03:39,240 --> 00:03:42,900
<font color="#E5E5E5">would cause tension in your breathing</font>

83
00:03:40,770 --> 00:03:45,060
through your mouth and jaw you're

when you read the blog post down below

92
00:04:02,580 --> 00:04:08,730
but to answer<font color="#E5E5E5"> your question guys the way</font>

93
00:04:05,489 --> 00:04:12,989
we access our animality our humanity our

94
00:04:08,729 --> 00:04:16,918
sexuality is by honoring and bringing

95
00:04:12,989 --> 00:04:18,329
life<font color="#CCCCCC"> back into the body getting in touch</font>

96
00:04:16,918 --> 00:04:19,798
with our<font color="#CCCCCC"> emotions getting in touch with</font>

00:04:18,329 --> 00:04:22,199
our feelings<font color="#E5E5E5"> getting in touch with our</font>

98
00:04:19,798 --> 00:04:26,009
sexuality and it<font color="#CCCCCC"> begins with accessing</font>

00:04:22,199 --> 00:04:28,979
it through the breath breathing

100
