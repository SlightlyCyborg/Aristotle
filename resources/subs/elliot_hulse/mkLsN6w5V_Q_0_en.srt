1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,120
so some people<font color="#CCCCCC"> asked me Elliot what are</font>

2
00:00:01,620 --> 00:00:05,490
you some sort of<font color="#E5E5E5"> a know-it-all what are</font>

3
00:00:03,120 --> 00:00:08,309
you a psychologist or sociologist or<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

4
00:00:05,490 --> 00:00:10,349
politician<font color="#E5E5E5"> well the fact is that I</font>

5
00:00:08,308 --> 00:00:13,109
expose myself to a lot of ideas I think

6
00:00:10,349 --> 00:00:15,089
a lot and I share my<font color="#E5E5E5"> ideas now if you're</font>

7
00:00:13,109 --> 00:00:16,800
offended by that you believe that you

8
00:00:15,089 --> 00:00:18,660
need a label in order to<font color="#E5E5E5"> think on</font>

9
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:20,969
certain topics that means you're a

10
00:00:18,660 --> 00:00:22,559
victim of your own psychological bondage

11
00:00:20,969 --> 00:00:24,390
either that or you<font color="#E5E5E5"> haven't given</font>

12
00:00:22,559 --> 00:00:28,948
yourself the freedom to express yourself

13
00:00:24,390 --> 00:00:30,480
fully so if my freedom offends you then

14
00:00:28,949 --> 00:00:32,630
the first place<font color="#CCCCCC"> you should look</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to solve</font>

15
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:35,899
that problem would be<font color="#E5E5E5"> the mirror</font>

16
00:00:32,630 --> 00:00:35,899
<font color="#CCCCCC">Elliot's it</font>
