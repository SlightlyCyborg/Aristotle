1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,950
<font color="#CCCCCC">Oh like what the hybrid training you you</font>

2
00:00:05,910 --> 00:00:12,048
think it's best to combine it in that

3
00:00:07,950 --> 00:00:15,179
one workout or or to do like a week of

4
00:00:12,048 --> 00:00:18,390
strength training followed by then by a

5
00:00:15,179 --> 00:00:19,980
week of sarcoplasmic then or by doing

6
00:00:18,390 --> 00:00:21,859
like a whole month of just strength

7
00:00:19,980 --> 00:00:24,089
training and then like a month of

8
00:00:21,859 --> 00:00:26,310
sarcoplasmic training or is it best to

9
00:00:24,089 --> 00:00:27,778
just do it like<font color="#CCCCCC"> I said first in one</font>

10
00:00:26,309 --> 00:00:29,788
workout like combine it in that one

11
00:00:27,778 --> 00:00:31,349
session when you a really good book

12
00:00:29,789 --> 00:00:33,570
that's going to support what I want to

13
00:00:31,349 --> 00:00:36,679
say<font color="#CCCCCC"> right now me that you read a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> easy</font>

14
00:00:33,570 --> 00:00:39,270
shrink you can shrink D'Angela model

15
00:00:36,679 --> 00:00:40,619
awesome awesome book I don't like the

16
00:00:39,270 --> 00:00:42,809
way<font color="#E5E5E5"> it was written this more of a</font>

17
00:00:40,619 --> 00:00:44,339
conversational style but it's a really

18
00:00:42,808 --> 00:00:46,909
<font color="#E5E5E5">good book and it gives different</font>

19
00:00:44,340 --> 00:00:49,730
quadrants different types of athletes

20
00:00:46,909 --> 00:00:51,750
and you have like athletes that have to

21
00:00:49,729 --> 00:00:55,288
really focus and concentrate on

22
00:00:51,750 --> 00:00:58,159
<font color="#E5E5E5">development of one skilled how other</font>

23
00:00:55,289 --> 00:01:02,010
thing would be like that<font color="#CCCCCC"> you're</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you're</font>

24
00:00:58,159 --> 00:01:04,079
specializing then you have a<font color="#E5E5E5"> far in</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

25
00:01:02,009 --> 00:01:08,039
<font color="#E5E5E5">destruction you've got athletes that</font>

26
00:01:04,079 --> 00:01:10,590
need to be all things a football player

27
00:01:08,040 --> 00:01:12,390
a linebacker would be that it needs to

28
00:01:10,590 --> 00:01:15,118
be sure to power lifter he's got to be

29
00:01:12,390 --> 00:01:17,009
powerful like a Olympic lifter he's got

30
00:01:15,118 --> 00:01:18,030
to be able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to sprint like a sprinter but</font>

31
00:01:17,009 --> 00:01:19,379
he also could have to be able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to jump</font>

32
00:01:18,030 --> 00:01:21,329
<font color="#CCCCCC">like a jumper it's going to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> be</font>

33
00:01:19,379 --> 00:01:24,890
aggressive<font color="#E5E5E5"> knock the crap out of people</font>

34
00:01:21,329 --> 00:01:28,530
but<font color="#E5E5E5"> he also has to be tenacious and</font>

35
00:01:24,890 --> 00:01:31,079
agile enough to move that's a<font color="#CCCCCC"> hybrid</font>

36
00:01:28,530 --> 00:01:32,790
athlete and the way or hybrid athlete

37
00:01:31,078 --> 00:01:34,259
becomes a hybrid athlete right we've all

38
00:01:32,790 --> 00:01:38,009
that shit at once when that ball is

39
00:01:34,259 --> 00:01:39,810
snapped it's either bang or you know I'm

40
00:01:38,009 --> 00:01:42,359
saying he's going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be able to all that</font>

41
00:01:39,810 --> 00:01:44,399
the same time my opinion is if your

42
00:01:42,359 --> 00:01:47,340
first of all depends<font color="#E5E5E5"> on what you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> want</font>

43
00:01:44,399 --> 00:01:50,070
you know if your aid I look that's how

44
00:01:47,340 --> 00:01:53,118
you know if you're trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to build up to</font>

45
00:01:50,069 --> 00:01:53,118
a thousand pound squat

46
00:01:54,489 --> 00:01:58,759
general conditioning I think that's the

47
00:01:56,629 --> 00:02:00,709
<font color="#E5E5E5">best kind of athlete to be I want</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to be</font>

48
00:01:58,759 --> 00:02:02,328
able to power clean 315 I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to be</font>

49
00:02:00,709 --> 00:02:04,669
able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to deadlift 600 how's that I won't</font>

50
00:02:02,328 --> 00:02:08,750
<font color="#E5E5E5">be able to jump let's go 50 pound box of</font>

51
00:02:04,670 --> 00:02:12,439
<font color="#E5E5E5">15 inch box you don't say so like Chris</font>

52
00:02:08,750 --> 00:02:14,479
and alcohol to start<font color="#E5E5E5"> training together</font>

53
00:02:12,439 --> 00:02:19,340
in a<font color="#E5E5E5"> while but the training will look a</font>

54
00:02:14,479 --> 00:02:21,469
lot like they will be hybrid but I'm

55
00:02:19,340 --> 00:02:24,979
trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to give an example I will do copy</font>

56
00:02:21,469 --> 00:02:30,799
sets of stones and then we'll do heavy

57
00:02:24,979 --> 00:02:33,889
deadlifts followed by reverse would jobs

58
00:02:30,799 --> 00:02:37,849
and its body good classic<font color="#CCCCCC"> shorter so</font>

59
00:02:33,889 --> 00:02:39,469
it's best insulated that one session so

60
00:02:37,848 --> 00:02:43,969
make accurate because I don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> harm</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> train</font>

61
00:02:39,469 --> 00:02:47,750
at a gym a clear so have certain things

62
00:02:43,969 --> 00:02:50,120
<font color="#E5E5E5">that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> are accessible so good i program</font>

63
00:02:47,750 --> 00:02:53,389
would be<font color="#E5E5E5"> almost like</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I said in the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> video</font>

64
00:02:50,120 --> 00:02:55,159
Chris up with this morning on the west

65
00:02:53,389 --> 00:02:58,608
side template what site template is

66
00:02:55,159 --> 00:03:00,769
although it's a powerlifting template

67
00:02:58,609 --> 00:03:03,650
<font color="#CCCCCC">Bay different colleges it can be</font>

68
00:03:00,769 --> 00:03:05,810
modified to be very it's very high as

69
00:03:03,650 --> 00:03:07,159
you lift heavy then you can do some

70
00:03:05,810 --> 00:03:10,670
dynamic work and you can use a

71
00:03:07,159 --> 00:03:12,229
bodybuilding right you see I think<font color="#CCCCCC"> but I</font>

72
00:03:10,669 --> 00:03:14,750
think<font color="#CCCCCC"> the blending the three of those</font>

73
00:03:12,229 --> 00:03:18,729
gigantic work now looking bodybuilding

74
00:03:14,750 --> 00:03:21,919
creates a really solid strong athlete

75
00:03:18,729 --> 00:03:24,619
lift heavy with with high volume and be

76
00:03:21,919 --> 00:03:28,578
explosive that's really its intensity

77
00:03:24,620 --> 00:03:30,340
volume and speed Timbo it was it really

78
00:03:28,579 --> 00:03:34,340
the three<font color="#E5E5E5"> parameters at you messing with</font>

79
00:03:30,340 --> 00:03:38,239
<font color="#CCCCCC">intensity is wait volume is pop is by</font>

80
00:03:34,340 --> 00:03:41,090
yielding and speed tempo<font color="#E5E5E5"> is jump sprint</font>

81
00:03:38,239 --> 00:03:45,069
throw add those into your program since

82
00:03:41,090 --> 00:03:45,069
you're always still very athletic
