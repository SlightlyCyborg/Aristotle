you've like created in your<font color="#E5E5E5"> life is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> like</font>

28
00:01:05,688 --> 00:01:10,500
you probably<font color="#E5E5E5"> can't even comprehend it</font>

29
00:01:07,859 --> 00:01:14,188
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay cool that's an animal so each prop</font>

30
00:01:10,500 --> 00:01:15,269
to that but anyways um I really

31
00:01:14,188 --> 00:01:19,109
appreciate your vice because it's

32
00:01:15,269 --> 00:01:22,109
genuine and um I feel like on any advice

33
00:01:19,109 --> 00:01:26,849
there's always layers and<font color="#CCCCCC"> the deeper you</font>

34
00:01:22,109 --> 00:01:29,640
go there's like someone's basic beliefs

35
00:01:26,849 --> 00:01:31,679
about the<font color="#E5E5E5"> nature of reality and just</font>

36
00:01:29,640 --> 00:01:33,390
like like when I wake up in the morning

37
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:35,460
I'm like what the fuck is going on like

38
00:01:33,390 --> 00:01:37,109
why do I exist and i'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> just curious</font>

39
00:01:35,459 --> 00:01:39,629
what's your like deepest beliefs about

40
00:01:37,109 --> 00:01:41,780
just what's going on just the nature of

41
00:01:39,629 --> 00:01:41,780
reality

42
00:01:44,299 --> 00:01:47,759
one thing that I would<font color="#CCCCCC"> like to say is</font>

43
00:01:46,618 --> 00:01:52,409
<font color="#CCCCCC">that I think we</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> take it way too</font>

44
00:01:47,759 --> 00:01:54,689
seriously we've been taught to to really

45
00:01:52,409 --> 00:01:56,399
to believe because that's what<font color="#CCCCCC"> it is is</font>

46
00:01:54,689 --> 00:01:58,408
purely a belief<font color="#E5E5E5"> that number one we're</font>

47
00:01:56,399 --> 00:02:01,049
separate from one another that we're

48
00:01:58,409 --> 00:02:04,109
just this like this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is it that's all you</font>

49
00:02:01,049 --> 00:02:07,229
get you know just as meat suit and it's

50
00:02:04,109 --> 00:02:09,538
<font color="#CCCCCC">a big</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> lie but I have so much fun</font>

51
00:02:07,228 --> 00:02:11,879
manipulating the variables<font color="#E5E5E5"> of my life</font>

52
00:02:09,538 --> 00:02:15,238
knowing that the reality is i'm way more

53
00:02:11,879 --> 00:02:18,539
than what you<font color="#E5E5E5"> see and with that type of</font>

54
00:02:15,239 --> 00:02:21,150
freedom comes the courage to do whatever

55
00:02:18,539 --> 00:02:22,500
<font color="#E5E5E5">you want to do see your you've got kind</font>

56
00:02:21,150 --> 00:02:23,819
of that courageous attitude about you

57
00:02:22,500 --> 00:02:26,250
that's why you can do the pickup thing

58
00:02:23,818 --> 00:02:27,869
and other guys want to do that well

59
00:02:26,250 --> 00:02:29,939
regardless of what language you<font color="#E5E5E5"> used to</font>

60
00:02:27,870 --> 00:02:32,810
<font color="#E5E5E5">describe it the fact is that you are</font>

61
00:02:29,939 --> 00:02:36,840
moving<font color="#E5E5E5"> from a place of understanding</font>

62
00:02:32,810 --> 00:02:38,849
which says<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm not</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> just this so I have</font>

63
00:02:36,840 --> 00:02:40,049
enough balls to just walk up<font color="#CCCCCC"> to a woman</font>

64
00:02:38,849 --> 00:02:41,879
and do whatever I want because there's

65
00:02:40,049 --> 00:02:45,269
way more going on here than just what

66
00:02:41,879 --> 00:02:47,489
you're seeing<font color="#CCCCCC"> yeah right because</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it's a</font>

67
00:02:45,269 --> 00:02:48,689
manifestation of your experiences<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're</font>

68
00:02:47,489 --> 00:02:50,219
going to do the<font color="#CCCCCC"> things that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you do based</font>

69
00:02:48,689 --> 00:02:52,259
on your experiences and experiences are

70
00:02:50,219 --> 00:02:54,870
where they're dead they're in the air

71
00:02:52,259 --> 00:02:58,530
somewhere you're going to do<font color="#E5E5E5"> things</font>

72
00:02:54,870 --> 00:03:00,150
based on your trust in the future like

73
00:02:58,530 --> 00:03:03,209
where's the future know where it's in

74
00:03:00,150 --> 00:03:05,480
the air yeah and if you can if you have

75
00:03:03,209 --> 00:03:08,909
that type of ability to like detach

76
00:03:05,479 --> 00:03:10,409
detach from our you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know the physical</font>

77
00:03:08,909 --> 00:03:12,299
manifestation of what's happening and

78
00:03:10,409 --> 00:03:14,699
realize there's a far greater reality

79
00:03:12,299 --> 00:03:17,000
then life is so<font color="#E5E5E5"> much more entertaining</font>

80
00:03:14,699 --> 00:03:22,319
because you won't take it<font color="#E5E5E5"> so seriously</font>

81
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:24,060
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is all is yeah yeah one of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> my core</font>

82
00:03:22,319 --> 00:03:26,340
beliefs I've been just experimenting

83
00:03:24,060 --> 00:03:29,459
with is that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know like when you go</font>

84
00:03:26,340 --> 00:03:31,950
to<font color="#CCCCCC"> sleep and when</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you dream um your</font>

85
00:03:29,459 --> 00:03:33,539
consciousness isn't just your body in

86
00:03:31,949 --> 00:03:35,518
your dream but your consciousness is

87
00:03:33,539 --> 00:03:36,929
actually the whole dream world you're

88
00:03:35,519 --> 00:03:38,640
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> other dream characters ult you're</font>

89
00:03:36,930 --> 00:03:41,010
the whole dream world and while you're

90
00:03:38,639 --> 00:03:42,419
in the dream it feels so real like that

91
00:03:41,009 --> 00:03:43,979
you're the character<font color="#E5E5E5"> and then suddenly</font>

92
00:03:42,419 --> 00:03:47,309
<font color="#E5E5E5">you wake up and you realize you're</font>

93
00:03:43,979 --> 00:03:49,909
actually the whole dream world and yep

94
00:03:47,310 --> 00:03:53,870
oh that's such a fun thought it's also

95
00:03:49,909 --> 00:03:56,359
and to me beliefs are just different

96
00:03:53,870 --> 00:03:57,530
lenses on how to look at reality there's

97
00:03:56,360 --> 00:04:01,850
like<font color="#E5E5E5"> who knows what's right or wrong</font>

98
00:03:57,530 --> 00:04:03,860
grades yeah but um so for me yeah

99
00:04:01,849 --> 00:04:05,060
beliefs my whole life I've been trying

100
00:04:03,860 --> 00:04:07,630
<font color="#E5E5E5">to figure</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> out one of the most empowering</font>

101
00:04:05,060 --> 00:04:10,129
beliefs that I can believe in right and

102
00:04:07,629 --> 00:04:11,449
<font color="#E5E5E5">I'm working for you I'm not truly the</font>

103
00:04:10,129 --> 00:04:12,859
question I asked you about<font color="#CCCCCC"> their beliefs</font>

104
00:04:11,449 --> 00:04:14,449
like they're so attached to their

105
00:04:12,860 --> 00:04:15,860
beliefs their personally identified with

106
00:04:14,449 --> 00:04:18,289
them<font color="#E5E5E5"> even though there's there's no</font>

107
00:04:15,860 --> 00:04:20,030
rational reason why but that's okay you

108
00:04:18,290 --> 00:04:21,739
<font color="#CCCCCC">don't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> need to rationalize all you got to</font>

109
00:04:20,029 --> 00:04:23,929
do is<font color="#E5E5E5"> say well how's that working for</font>

110
00:04:21,738 --> 00:04:25,519
you and if they're sick sad depressed

111
00:04:23,930 --> 00:04:27,590
their wife cheats on them and their kids

112
00:04:25,519 --> 00:04:29,349
don't respect them and you know those

113
00:04:27,589 --> 00:04:32,000
beliefs aren't working for you bro yeah

114
00:04:29,350 --> 00:04:34,160
try some new ones but they can't because

115
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:36,529
you know they might go to hell yeah and

116
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:37,910
<font color="#CCCCCC">I was talking to steve pavlina he really</font>

117
00:04:36,529 --> 00:04:39,919
explain about to me<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's like belief</font>

118
00:04:37,910 --> 00:04:41,840
sent something to be attached to<font color="#E5E5E5"> believe</font>

119
00:04:39,920 --> 00:04:43,160
somewhere of a<font color="#CCCCCC"> toolbox</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and you could</font>

120
00:04:41,839 --> 00:04:45,649
take<font color="#E5E5E5"> a belief and just look through that</font>

121
00:04:43,160 --> 00:04:47,720
belief and see what happens and if it

122
00:04:45,649 --> 00:04:49,159
doesn't work<font color="#E5E5E5"> I well if it does work cool</font>

123
00:04:47,720 --> 00:04:51,140
but it's not yours you don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> have</font>

124
00:04:49,160 --> 00:04:53,420
ownership of the belief that you could

125
00:04:51,139 --> 00:04:57,649
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> could use</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it like like a tool almost</font>

126
00:04:53,420 --> 00:04:59,120
that's a so well one of the beliefs I've

127
00:04:57,649 --> 00:05:00,679
been experimenting with that which<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

128
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:02,810
really cool because you hit<font color="#E5E5E5"> on this lot</font>

129
00:05:00,680 --> 00:05:05,720
like you last feed about like we just

130
00:05:02,810 --> 00:05:08,120
ignore everyone is that I believe like

131
00:05:05,720 --> 00:05:12,169
real life is basically basically like a

132
00:05:08,120 --> 00:05:13,970
dream<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a like I have I don't just</font>

133
00:05:12,168 --> 00:05:17,120
<font color="#E5E5E5">have control over just</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Mia but actually</font>

134
00:05:13,970 --> 00:05:19,160
everything in my environment is mia like

135
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:21,290
<font color="#E5E5E5">you're me right now you're part of my</font>

136
00:05:19,160 --> 00:05:22,910
subconscious somewhere that's reflecting

137
00:05:21,290 --> 00:05:24,770
Mia I'm a part of your subconscious

138
00:05:22,910 --> 00:05:26,930
that's reflecting you we're both real

139
00:05:24,769 --> 00:05:28,579
<font color="#CCCCCC">we're both we're both real but we're in</font>

140
00:05:26,930 --> 00:05:30,560
like this mutual dream together and

141
00:05:28,579 --> 00:05:33,168
we're like slowly like<font color="#E5E5E5"> I believe on god</font>

142
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:38,629
in the limited form and I'm waking up<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

143
00:05:33,168 --> 00:05:40,639
my true infinite powers like it sounds

144

00:06:31,180 --> 00:06:34,139
playing with ourselves cuz it's like

well you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know what we're all gonna die</font>

170
00:06:34,139 --> 00:06:38,500
and we can become sad about that we

171
00:06:36,790 --> 00:06:41,319
could be sad about people who are dying

172
00:06:38,500 --> 00:06:43,720
because of the game but even<font color="#E5E5E5"> then you</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">are now a slave to this to a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> belief that</font>

I'm so influential is because I'll say

284
00:10:57,690 --> 00:11:03,390
whatever the fuck you're thinking and a

285
00:11:00,360 --> 00:11:05,100
lot of times I I hesitate but I'm like I

286
00:11:03,389 --> 00:11:07,080
guarantee<font color="#CCCCCC"> that what I'm about to say</font>

287
00:11:05,100 --> 00:11:10,409
although will piss a lot of people off

288
00:11:07,080 --> 00:11:13,139
the greater majority are gonna say oh my

289
00:11:10,409 --> 00:11:15,179
<font color="#CCCCCC">god i thought the same thing except no</font>

290
00:11:13,139 --> 00:11:17,490
one has<font color="#CCCCCC"> the balls to say it no one's</font>

291
00:11:15,179 --> 00:11:18,779
trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to look at it in themselves and</font>

292
00:11:17,490 --> 00:11:21,210
they sure as hell ain't gonna tell

293
00:11:18,779 --> 00:11:22,559
anybody else<font color="#CCCCCC"> so it's a form like you're</font>

294
00:11:21,210 --> 00:11:24,230
saying it's a form of liberation<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm</font>

295
00:11:22,559 --> 00:11:26,669
<font color="#E5E5E5">basically giving you permission to say</font>

296
00:11:24,230 --> 00:11:30,000
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> guy is a lot allowing</font>

297
00:11:26,669 --> 00:11:32,610
himself to be himself to be nuts yeah

298
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:35,460
then maybe it's okay that I am too yeah

299
00:11:32,610 --> 00:11:37,889
I really like what you're saying with<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

300
00:11:35,460 --> 00:11:39,250
<font color="#E5E5E5">Frank yang like people I've like energy</font>

301
00:11:37,889 --> 00:11:41,620
built up in them

302
00:11:39,250 --> 00:11:42,759
and right and a bit like one<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the</font>

303
00:11:41,620 --> 00:11:45,879
healthiest things to do if your life is

304
00:11:42,759 --> 00:11:47,710
to release that<font color="#CCCCCC"> energy and yeah right</font>

305
00:11:45,879 --> 00:11:48,850
the best way to do that<font color="#CCCCCC"> is you and I'm</font>

306
00:11:47,710 --> 00:11:52,480
<font color="#E5E5E5">missing something of your videos is</font>

307
00:11:48,850 --> 00:11:53,860
being vulnerable just like like and my

308
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:57,580
method being vulnerable is like I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> just</font>

309
00:11:53,860 --> 00:11:59,169
<font color="#E5E5E5">in a dream like everyone's me is so why</font>

310
00:11:57,580 --> 00:12:01,000
won't I tell people my true self you

311
00:11:59,169 --> 00:12:02,169
know why I hide anything from anyone

312
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:05,139
because everyone's you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> what you do</font>

313
00:12:02,169 --> 00:12:07,569
though you take risks yeah it may<font color="#E5E5E5"> seem</font>

314
00:12:05,139 --> 00:12:09,610
at a little risk you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know some people it</font>

315
00:12:07,570 --> 00:12:11,920
up a big deal<font color="#CCCCCC"> he talks to girls well</font>

316
00:12:09,610 --> 00:12:13,389
some guys got<font color="#E5E5E5"> a life-threatening risk I</font>

317
00:12:11,919 --> 00:12:14,889
mean the physiological changes in their

318
00:12:13,389 --> 00:12:16,509
body when a women comes the woman comes

319
00:12:14,889 --> 00:12:17,980
near is like it's almost<font color="#E5E5E5"> as if like</font>

320
00:12:16,509 --> 00:12:19,990
someone put a gun to their<font color="#E5E5E5"> head</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> there so</font>

321
00:12:17,980 --> 00:12:23,430
they're so stressed out but you<font color="#CCCCCC"> have the</font>

322
00:12:19,990 --> 00:12:25,840
courage<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> just do whatever your heart</font>

323
00:12:23,429 --> 00:12:28,449
desire and that<font color="#E5E5E5"> takes a shit load of</font>

324
00:12:25,840 --> 00:12:30,460
courage and<font color="#E5E5E5"> self transcendence and see</font>

325
00:12:28,450 --> 00:12:32,470
what's what's an even higher form of

326
00:12:30,460 --> 00:12:34,330
courage to<font color="#E5E5E5"> me is like being vulnerable</font>

327
00:12:32,470 --> 00:12:36,460
and sing up in things<font color="#CCCCCC"> like</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> she had on</font>

328
00:12:34,330 --> 00:12:37,870
like going up and talking to girls is

329
00:12:36,460 --> 00:12:39,970
like that though I'm such an alpha male

330
00:12:37,870 --> 00:12:42,639
like look<font color="#E5E5E5"> at</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> me it's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> almost like an ego</font>

331
00:12:39,970 --> 00:12:44,050
form of courage oh gosh it it's a story

332
00:12:42,639 --> 00:12:45,879
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> you're telling</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> yourself it helps</font>

333
00:12:44,049 --> 00:12:48,189
yeah but when<font color="#CCCCCC"> you're actually vulnerable</font>

334
00:12:45,879 --> 00:12:49,750
um my most popular vlog video right now

335
00:12:48,190 --> 00:12:53,170
is a video where I talk about porn and

336
00:12:49,750 --> 00:12:54,309
masturbation and I'm just rip all this

337
00:12:53,169 --> 00:12:56,259
I'm like I've watched<font color="#E5E5E5"> your shift on the</font>

338
00:12:54,309 --> 00:12:59,529
floor and sometimes I'll jack up six

339
00:12:56,259 --> 00:13:02,139
times a day guys<font color="#CCCCCC"> oh yeah like you know</font>

340
00:12:59,529 --> 00:13:03,279
what most people have<font color="#E5E5E5"> to it was actually</font>

341
00:13:02,139 --> 00:13:06,429
<font color="#E5E5E5">really hard for me to upload that video</font>

342
00:13:03,279 --> 00:13:07,750
mic wave<font color="#E5E5E5"> I got but uploading that video</font>

343
00:13:06,429 --> 00:13:10,419
was<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually harder than talking to</font>

344
00:13:07,750 --> 00:13:12,460
girls and and like people<font color="#CCCCCC"> are like</font>

345
00:13:10,419 --> 00:13:14,169
because I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> just opening up about</font>

346
00:13:12,460 --> 00:13:16,480
something that's I had all this energy

347
00:13:14,169 --> 00:13:18,159
built up inside Mia about<font color="#E5E5E5"> like porn and</font>

348
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:19,570
masturbation and kind of<font color="#E5E5E5"> some guilt I</font>

349
00:13:18,159 --> 00:13:22,179
just<font color="#E5E5E5"> had to release that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> world</font>

350
00:13:19,570 --> 00:13:23,680
and just your video not releasing energy

351
00:13:22,179 --> 00:13:25,779
really motivated me to do that it's like

352
00:13:23,679 --> 00:13:28,838
gotta get this pressure out<font color="#CCCCCC"> of me oh</font>

353
00:13:25,779 --> 00:13:31,750
yeah totally have to because life is it

354
00:13:28,839 --> 00:13:33,820
is a movement and if we're not moving it

355
00:13:31,750 --> 00:13:36,129
we're competing it and like to try to

356
00:13:33,820 --> 00:13:38,230
happen through you the only thing you

357
00:13:36,129 --> 00:13:41,169
could<font color="#E5E5E5"> possibly do besides let go and</font>

358
00:13:38,230 --> 00:13:42,909
allow life happen is holding it and

359
00:13:41,169 --> 00:13:44,588
that's monkey uncomfortable because

360
00:13:42,909 --> 00:13:45,360
number one you're stressing yourself out

361
00:13:44,589 --> 00:13:49,279
now you're old

362
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:52,980
shit and number two you're literally a

363
00:13:49,278 --> 00:13:55,019
roadblock to God or<font color="#E5E5E5"> the universe to do</font>

364
00:13:52,980 --> 00:13:56,399
it's fricking thing and God or the

365
00:13:55,019 --> 00:13:58,049
universe doesn't<font color="#CCCCCC"> make any mistakes</font>

366
00:13:56,399 --> 00:14:00,539
doesn't fuck up we think we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> trying to</font>

367
00:13:58,049 --> 00:14:02,819
fix nature but as I go it's getting away

368
00:14:00,539 --> 00:14:04,980
nature wants to do this through me as

369
00:14:02,820 --> 00:14:06,839
long as I know I'm out<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the way that</font>

370
00:14:04,980 --> 00:14:09,829
it's right no<font color="#E5E5E5"> matter what anyone else</font>

371
00:14:06,839 --> 00:14:12,180
thinks or says yeah completely agreed<font color="#CCCCCC"> um</font>

372
00:14:09,828 --> 00:14:13,229
it's cool because I've seen<font color="#E5E5E5"> you go</font>

373
00:14:12,179 --> 00:14:15,120
through<font color="#E5E5E5"> all these paradigms in your</font>

374
00:14:13,230 --> 00:14:17,459
videos and then while I'm living my life

375
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:19,110
the paradigms will come<font color="#E5E5E5"> true it's like</font>

376
00:14:17,458 --> 00:14:21,509
it's like<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're kind of my guide to</font>

377
00:14:19,110 --> 00:14:24,000
life I watch it<font color="#CCCCCC"> I that's interesting and</font>

378
00:14:21,509 --> 00:14:25,950
<font color="#CCCCCC">I'll go out and like whoa that's like</font>

379
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:30,000
<font color="#E5E5E5">I'll try out your your idea isn't big</font>

380
00:14:25,950 --> 00:14:32,310
that's true it works and another<font color="#E5E5E5"> great</font>

381
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:35,610
um yeah like your thing it's like

382
00:14:32,309 --> 00:14:38,278
yielding to the universe to me like the

383
00:14:35,610 --> 00:14:39,750
universe is like a river and the cool

384
00:14:38,278 --> 00:14:42,389
thing about my picking up girls videos

385
00:14:39,750 --> 00:14:44,820
is like my pranks is<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's there's like</font>

386
00:14:42,389 --> 00:14:46,769
girls upstream and I'm like all right

387
00:14:44,820 --> 00:14:49,740
I'm gonna puffle upstream to try to pick

388
00:14:46,769 --> 00:14:51,509
up these girls and the funny thing is I

389
00:14:49,740 --> 00:14:53,100
like all the girls<font color="#E5E5E5"> i picked up in those</font>

390
00:14:51,509 --> 00:14:57,240
videos i like never had any chemistry

391
00:14:53,100 --> 00:14:59,310
with it was weird and i realize i was

392
00:14:57,240 --> 00:15:01,409
going against like God and nature you

393
00:14:59,309 --> 00:15:04,469
know I was going upstream those you go

394
00:15:01,409 --> 00:15:07,500
you're performing it was very<font color="#CCCCCC"> good yes</font>

395
00:15:04,470 --> 00:15:09,660
but but it was<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually going downstream</font>

396
00:15:07,500 --> 00:15:10,980
and to learn the lesson like going

397
00:15:09,659 --> 00:15:12,389
upstream is going downstream to learn

398
00:15:10,980 --> 00:15:14,250
the lesson in the future if that makes

399
00:15:12,389 --> 00:15:15,750
sense you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> say yes yeah I get it</font>

400
00:15:14,250 --> 00:15:19,740
you're putting forth effort so that you

401
00:15:15,750 --> 00:15:21,179
can learn how<font color="#CCCCCC"> to let go God</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> yeah so</font>

402
00:15:19,740 --> 00:15:26,730
Elliot what are your biggest desires in

403
00:15:21,179 --> 00:15:28,769
life right<font color="#CCCCCC"> now</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I I had this conversation</font>

404
00:15:26,730 --> 00:15:30,449
with someone earlier today it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> almost</font>

405
00:15:28,769 --> 00:15:32,909
<font color="#E5E5E5">like once when two people are dancing</font>

406
00:15:30,448 --> 00:15:34,859
you're dancing and I mean truly dancing

407
00:15:32,909 --> 00:15:37,289
you're fully enrolled in the movement

408
00:15:34,860 --> 00:15:40,110
independent music and that other

409
00:15:37,289 --> 00:15:43,528
individual you don't dance with hopes of

410
00:15:40,110 --> 00:15:45,240
an end you you don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> express</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that way</font>

411
00:15:43,528 --> 00:15:47,129
so that you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can get to the end the</font>

412
00:15:45,240 --> 00:15:49,799
purpose of a dance is<font color="#E5E5E5"> not to finish it</font>

413
00:15:47,129 --> 00:15:51,419
and we're constantly looking for ends I

414
00:15:49,799 --> 00:15:53,278
do the<font color="#CCCCCC"> same</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> thing and I'm learning how</font>

415
00:15:51,419 --> 00:15:55,078
not to wear constant looking for a goal

416
00:15:53,278 --> 00:15:57,179
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know they say</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it means to an end and</font>

417
00:15:55,078 --> 00:15:57,919
then<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is basically a goal goal I</font>

418
00:15:57,179 --> 00:15:59,388
don't want it

419
00:15:57,919 --> 00:16:01,669
and I'm not<font color="#E5E5E5"> that interested in ends</font>

420
00:15:59,389 --> 00:16:04,399
right now what I'm really<font color="#CCCCCC"> interested</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

421
00:16:01,669 --> 00:16:08,990
is this dance of life and growing more

422
00:16:04,399 --> 00:16:11,690
and more sensitive to how the God that

423
00:16:08,990 --> 00:16:13,669
I'm dancing with wants to take this

424
00:16:11,690 --> 00:16:16,970
dance with me because it's part me and

425
00:16:13,669 --> 00:16:19,039
it's part it so as the universe dances

426
00:16:16,970 --> 00:16:21,230
through me and I let it<font color="#E5E5E5"> and then I exert</font>

427
00:16:19,039 --> 00:16:23,750
a little bit we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> just having this fun</font>

431
00:16:30,620 --> 00:16:36,740
minute I have attachments goals and and

432
00:16:33,970 --> 00:16:39,800

<font color="#E5E5E5">love it a new way</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i like to look at</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> life</font>

438
00:16:51,230 --> 00:16:55,670
is instead<font color="#CCCCCC"> of see myself as a</font>

439
00:16:52,549 --> 00:16:58,189
protagonist like let's say there's a

440
00:16:55,669 --> 00:16:59,659
play going on and it says see myself is

441
00:16:58,190 --> 00:17:01,399
like a main character in the play<font color="#E5E5E5"> i like</font>

442
00:16:59,659 --> 00:17:03,799
to think of myself as almost like<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

443
00:17:01,399 --> 00:17:06,890
director of the plan like how can<font color="#CCCCCC"> i make</font>

444
00:17:03,799 --> 00:17:09,529
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> most cool magical interaction with</font>

445
00:17:06,890 --> 00:17:10,880
in<font color="#E5E5E5"> life right now and this is likely</font>

446
00:17:09,529 --> 00:17:12,798
you're saying<font color="#CCCCCC"> about being in the dance</font>

447
00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:15,309
it's just a whole new perspective then

448
00:17:12,798 --> 00:17:17,269
it's a way<font color="#E5E5E5"> to let that God spirit</font>

449
00:17:15,308 --> 00:17:19,609
whatever's going on it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> just a way to</font>

450
00:17:17,269 --> 00:17:23,000
allow that to work more with in<font color="#E5E5E5"> your</font>

451
00:17:19,609 --> 00:17:24,649
life there are two sides of the coin you

452
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:26,720
know and in<font color="#E5E5E5"> one of the parts is</font>

453
00:17:24,650 --> 00:17:28,339
aggression and that's we get<font color="#E5E5E5"> really</font>

454
00:17:26,720 --> 00:17:30,470
caught up in aggression<font color="#CCCCCC"> and aggression</font>

455
00:17:28,338 --> 00:17:33,200
is our ability<font color="#CCCCCC"> to manipulate what am i</font>

456
00:17:30,470 --> 00:17:36,558
<font color="#E5E5E5">doing to do this but what we forget</font>

457
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:38,600
quite often and in so many different

458
00:17:36,558 --> 00:17:40,369
ways is that that's only fifty percent

459
00:17:38,599 --> 00:17:43,250
<font color="#E5E5E5">of the game the other half is tenderness</font>

460
00:17:40,369 --> 00:17:46,039
and if<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> try to attach to fifty percent</font>

461
00:17:43,250 --> 00:17:48,650
of this coin half of the coin heads only

462
00:17:46,039 --> 00:17:51,168
I really miss the total game which means

463
00:17:48,650 --> 00:17:54,798
there's<font color="#CCCCCC"> gonna be some allowing so you do</font>

464
00:17:51,169 --> 00:17:57,650
and then<font color="#CCCCCC"> you allow you do you allow you</font>

465
00:17:54,798 --> 00:17:59,230
do you allow and really that's if you

466
00:17:57,650 --> 00:18:02,509
just study the nature of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> human body</font>

467
00:17:59,230 --> 00:18:04,160
it's kind of<font color="#E5E5E5"> exactly the way we live you</font>

468
00:18:02,509 --> 00:18:07,640
put food in your mouth what are you

469
00:18:04,160 --> 00:18:10,940
digesting it are you<font color="#E5E5E5"> assimilating the</font>

470
00:18:07,640 --> 00:18:11,600
nutrients are you deciding what's waste

471
00:18:10,940 --> 00:18:13,580
product

472
00:18:11,599 --> 00:18:16,038
then what needs to be filtered and you

473
00:18:13,579 --> 00:18:17,869
know how to to the peristalsis are you

474
00:18:16,038 --> 00:18:19,730
actually using the<font color="#E5E5E5"> muscles like you do</font>

475

<font color="#E5E5E5">this with your bicep the peristaltic</font>

478
00:18:25,160 --> 00:18:35,029
allowing that part it's half us half it

479
00:18:29,259 --> 00:18:36,829
no that's do you think you do you think

480
00:18:35,029 --> 00:18:40,308

485
00:18:46,819 --> 00:18:51,829
of human being we're<font color="#CCCCCC"> a physical</font>

486
00:18:49,190 --> 00:18:55,360
manifestation<font color="#CCCCCC"> of a cloud reality a</font>
