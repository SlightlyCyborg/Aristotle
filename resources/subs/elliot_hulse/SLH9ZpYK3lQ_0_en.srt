so<font color="#E5E5E5"> people often ask me how is it that I</font>

2
00:00:03,899 --> 00:00:10,080
I have such a wide array of

00:00:07,068 --> 00:00:12,330
understanding it and ideas people also

4
00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:14,160
want to know how is it Elliot<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

5
00:00:12,330 --> 00:00:16,320
you're interested<font color="#CCCCCC"> in so many divergent</font>

6
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:18,750
subjects for example I recently just put

7
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:21,778
a video of one of my favorite songs by

8
00:00:18,750 --> 00:00:24,948
the Beatles<font color="#CCCCCC"> blackbird on my youtube on</font>

10
00:00:24,949 --> 00:00:31,140
our shots and say Elliot I would never

11
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:33,719
imagine that you're a Beatles fan well

12
00:00:31,140 --> 00:00:35,789
here's the thing the reason why I'm able

13
00:00:33,719 --> 00:00:37,950
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> way you know it may seem</font>

14
00:00:35,789 --> 00:00:39,149
strange to many people that like you

15
00:00:37,950 --> 00:00:41,940
know for example I listen to country

16
00:00:39,149 --> 00:00:43,439
music or or<font color="#E5E5E5"> the fact that I can quote</font>

17
00:00:41,939 --> 00:00:46,649
the Bible but<font color="#E5E5E5"> I call my</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> don't call</font>

18
00:00:43,439 --> 00:00:50,250
myself a Christian I read the Quran I

19
00:00:46,649 --> 00:00:52,350
also read the Dow and<font color="#E5E5E5"> in fact I am very</font>

20
00:00:50,250 --> 00:00:55,049
intrigued<font color="#CCCCCC"> by the ideas of a lot of</font>

21
00:00:52,350 --> 00:00:57,600
atheists right so how is it<font color="#CCCCCC"> that someone</font>

22
00:00:55,049 --> 00:01:00,390
that can quote the Bible who who has a

23
00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:04,519
black face you know for example the way

24
00:01:00,390 --> 00:01:06,180
I look and not be attached<font color="#E5E5E5"> to the</font>

25
00:01:04,519 --> 00:01:08,340
associations with either of those things

26
00:01:06,180 --> 00:01:10,140
right<font color="#E5E5E5"> how is it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that I you know I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> quote</font>

27
00:01:08,340 --> 00:01:12,510
<font color="#E5E5E5">the Bible but yet I'm not attached to</font>

28
00:01:10,140 --> 00:01:15,629
<font color="#E5E5E5">the ideas in the Bible in such a way</font>

29
00:01:12,510 --> 00:01:17,900
that it is in a reflection of Who I am

30
00:01:15,629 --> 00:01:22,560
in other words I'm not personally

31
00:01:17,900 --> 00:01:25,200
<font color="#E5E5E5">attached it doesn't identify me right is</font>

32
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:28,560
in the same way that the<font color="#E5E5E5"> way I look my</font>

33
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:30,780
race like you know why should that

34
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:33,118
identify the type of music I listen to

35
00:01:30,780 --> 00:01:35,070
why should that identify the<font color="#CCCCCC"> the type of</font>

36
00:01:33,118 --> 00:01:38,909
conversations I engage in why should

37
00:01:35,069 --> 00:01:41,519
that identify the thoughts that I'm

38
00:01:38,909 --> 00:01:43,770
willing<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> consider and harbor the ideas</font>

39
00:01:41,519 --> 00:01:46,590
so what I want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to invite</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> do is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

40
00:01:43,769 --> 00:01:49,739
is to realize<font color="#CCCCCC"> that the biggest trouble</font>

41
00:01:46,590 --> 00:01:52,950
is when you<font color="#E5E5E5"> become so attached to an</font>

42
00:01:49,739 --> 00:01:56,188
idea<font color="#CCCCCC"> alright or a set of ideas a set of</font>

43
00:01:52,950 --> 00:02:00,060
virtues or in other words or religion or

44
00:01:56,188 --> 00:02:02,548
philosophy that you<font color="#E5E5E5"> close yourself off</font>

45
00:02:00,060 --> 00:02:05,609
<font color="#E5E5E5">to all the other amazing things that the</font>

46
00:02:02,549 --> 00:02:08,129
world has to offer even your enemy has

47
00:02:05,609 --> 00:02:11,370
something very interesting to offer

48
00:02:08,128 --> 00:02:12,539
instead of looking at your enemy and his

49
00:02:11,370 --> 00:02:15,390
ideas

50
00:02:12,539 --> 00:02:17,938
the origin of his ideas as something

51
00:02:15,389 --> 00:02:21,000
evil<font color="#E5E5E5"> and opposite of you and should be</font>

52
00:02:17,938 --> 00:02:23,280
shunned and turned away from embrace it

53
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:25,169
look at it there may be something there

54
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:27,688
<font color="#E5E5E5">and I found in fact that if there's</font>

55
00:02:25,169 --> 00:02:29,908
anything that people converge around if

56
00:02:27,688 --> 00:02:34,769
<font color="#E5E5E5">there's any idea beautiful Asif</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> E or</font>

religion an art music<font color="#E5E5E5"> poetry if there's</font>

anything that people converge around

59
00:02:36,060 --> 00:02:40,049
there's something potent there there's

60
00:02:38,039 --> 00:02:43,828
something nourishing there and it's

61
00:02:40,049 --> 00:02:47,310
worth your time to<font color="#CCCCCC"> look into</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so that's</font>

62
00:02:43,829 --> 00:02:51,560
<font color="#E5E5E5">how you open</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> yourself up to a wide array</font>

63
00:02:47,310 --> 00:02:54,389
of ideas and concepts and you further

you grow stronger you further facilitate

65
00:02:54,389 --> 00:03:00,239
your ability to remix ideas and come up

<font color="#E5E5E5">with your own the world is an idea</font>

playground take in as many ideas as you

can objectively look at it realistically

69
00:03:06,949 --> 00:03:12,798
blend the things that are useful to you

70

and create<font color="#CCCCCC"> your own</font>
