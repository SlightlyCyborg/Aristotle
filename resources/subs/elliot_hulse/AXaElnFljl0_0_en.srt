00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,129
what is your take on killing your master

2
00:00:02,629 --> 00:00:11,070
what would you<font color="#CCCCCC"> marry me say this yeah</font>

3
00:00:05,129 --> 00:00:17,000
did you read master<font color="#E5E5E5"> oh I've had a lot to</font>

4
00:00:11,070 --> 00:00:17,000
say this about<font color="#CCCCCC"> us right OH</font>

5
00:00:26,309 --> 00:00:32,939
I'm wrong I try to be right don't follow

6
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:45,579
actually eat he's a coffee Holly he

7
00:00:40,030 --> 00:00:50,620
likes expresso he likes a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of things</font>

8
00:00:45,579 --> 00:00:53,460
right under it like some refreshments

9
00:00:50,619 --> 00:00:53,459
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay</font>

10
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:06,219
person I've spoken about this way<font color="#CCCCCC"> we've</font>

11
00:01:03,738 --> 00:01:06,219
<font color="#CCCCCC">had this conversation</font>

12
00:01:10,760 --> 00:01:16,070
in a forward-moving world an aggressive

world in a male-dominated<font color="#E5E5E5"> world</font>

14
00:01:16,069 --> 00:01:21,319
especially<font color="#E5E5E5"> female oriented which</font>

15
00:01:18,319 --> 00:01:26,389
basically means goal achieving moving

16
00:01:21,319 --> 00:01:29,389
towards right we find that are best

17
00:01:26,390 --> 00:01:33,980
suited by finding someone ahead of us to

18
00:01:29,390 --> 00:01:36,049
support<font color="#E5E5E5"> us in moving forward but you end</font>

19
00:01:33,980 --> 00:01:37,820
up<font color="#E5E5E5"> in and if you're a very self</font>

20
00:01:36,049 --> 00:01:40,370
subjective person if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know how to</font>

21
00:01:37,819 --> 00:01:43,609
feel yourself you get<font color="#E5E5E5"> to a particular</font>

22
00:01:40,370 --> 00:01:46,370
point where the master has done enough

23
00:01:43,609 --> 00:01:48,680
and in order to<font color="#E5E5E5"> continue moving forward</font>

24
00:01:46,370 --> 00:01:51,350
not necessarily past him but in your own

25
00:01:48,680 --> 00:01:53,180
direction you've got to create contrast

26
00:01:51,349 --> 00:01:55,009
between him this is what teenagers do

27
00:01:53,180 --> 00:01:56,960
with their parents when they when

28
00:01:55,010 --> 00:01:58,640
they've gained enough and they've<font color="#CCCCCC"> got</font>

29
00:01:56,959 --> 00:02:01,179
the strength enough to move into<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

30
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:03,829
world they start looking for contrast

mommy and<font color="#E5E5E5"> daddy are Christian I'm going</font>

32
00:02:03,829 --> 00:02:08,959
to be Hindu do you see we start start

33
00:02:06,890 --> 00:02:11,509
trying to figure out<font color="#E5E5E5"> how we can separate</font>

34
00:02:08,959 --> 00:02:14,599
ourselves and it's healthy<font color="#E5E5E5"> because it</font>

35
00:02:11,509 --> 00:02:17,659
allows<font color="#CCCCCC"> us to that field our own identity</font>

36
00:02:14,599 --> 00:02:19,989
outside the umbrella of the master

37
00:02:17,659 --> 00:02:22,669
because<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can go one of two ways you</font>

38
00:02:19,989 --> 00:02:26,200
<font color="#CCCCCC">could you can build yourself up to the</font>

39
00:02:22,669 --> 00:02:28,699
master and then you can sit at its peak

40
00:02:26,199 --> 00:02:30,469
but if you do that you're doing<font color="#E5E5E5"> everyone</font>

41
00:02:28,699 --> 00:02:31,879
in this service get out<font color="#CCCCCC"> early doing</font>

42
00:02:30,469 --> 00:02:33,709
yourself a disservice because it's like

43
00:02:31,879 --> 00:02:36,379
whoa wait a second push it away and

44
00:02:33,709 --> 00:02:38,989
develop on your own a<font color="#E5E5E5"> little bit you</font>

45
00:02:36,379 --> 00:02:41,299
needed that you needed mommy you need<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

46
00:02:38,989 --> 00:02:43,640
daddy for a little while and we always

47
00:02:41,300 --> 00:02:46,969
<font color="#E5E5E5">need a mommy and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> daddy I to this day I</font>

48
00:02:43,639 --> 00:02:51,018
have been to work I got I just killed

49
00:02:46,969 --> 00:02:53,840
one of<font color="#E5E5E5"> my mentors right and I group up</font>

50
00:02:51,019 --> 00:02:57,730
<font color="#CCCCCC">to him and then I have to pull away from</font>

51
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:59,289
him but<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know what i discovered also</font>

52
00:02:57,729 --> 00:03:00,939
especially<font color="#CCCCCC"> if they're good mentors i</font>

53
00:02:59,289 --> 00:03:02,859
found<font color="#E5E5E5"> that because i put back to two</font>

54
00:03:00,939 --> 00:03:04,900
mentors that I'm killed I see other

55
00:03:02,860 --> 00:03:08,830
mentors that i'll come back to recycle

56
00:03:04,900 --> 00:03:10,510
<font color="#CCCCCC">but right now I've</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> got to grow so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> yeah</font>

57
00:03:08,830 --> 00:03:12,849
you do yourself you do the master a

58
00:03:10,509 --> 00:03:15,340
disservice because the maxtor is really

59
00:03:12,848 --> 00:03:18,539
only objective and the measure of the

60
00:03:15,340 --> 00:03:20,830
master is how<font color="#E5E5E5"> many other masters has</font>

61
00:03:18,539 --> 00:03:22,870
that's really the true measure of a

62
00:03:20,830 --> 00:03:26,849
master not how many<font color="#E5E5E5"> follow where she has</font>

63
00:03:22,870 --> 00:03:29,349
you see a master with a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of followers</font>

64
00:03:26,848 --> 00:03:33,189
something's<font color="#CCCCCC"> not right that's more of a</font>

65
00:03:29,348 --> 00:03:35,139
cult but if you see a master who a lot

66
00:03:33,189 --> 00:03:38,500
<font color="#E5E5E5">of other masters point to and say that</font>

67
00:03:35,139 --> 00:03:39,909
master<font color="#E5E5E5"> got me gotten kind of fog go to</font>

68
00:03:38,500 --> 00:03:41,829
this master because he'll help me too

69
00:03:39,909 --> 00:03:43,389
far to let you know that that but that's

70
00:03:41,829 --> 00:03:45,609
true<font color="#E5E5E5"> master because he's not interested</font>

71
00:03:43,389 --> 00:03:49,929
in followers he's interested<font color="#E5E5E5"> in creating</font>

72
00:03:45,609 --> 00:03:52,840
massive but in the mind of this student

73
00:03:49,930 --> 00:03:54,879
he has to create contrast he has to

74
00:03:52,840 --> 00:03:57,969
separate himself so that he could move

75
00:03:54,878 --> 00:04:00,328
over we do it with our dads none<font color="#CCCCCC"> of my</font>

76
00:03:57,969 --> 00:04:03,609
dad the funny thing is with my<font color="#E5E5E5"> dad I</font>

77
00:04:00,329 --> 00:04:07,599
gave my own mastery and I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that to</font>

78
00:04:03,609 --> 00:04:09,760
her nights I've had masters that in

79
00:04:07,598 --> 00:04:12,459
different realms of study where I come

80
00:04:09,759 --> 00:04:15,578
up to and then I'm<font color="#CCCCCC"> like got time to kill</font>

81
00:04:12,459 --> 00:04:17,620
your ass like crazy and and it's funny

82
00:04:15,579 --> 00:04:20,319
because the<font color="#E5E5E5"> mind does funny things and</font>

83
00:04:17,620 --> 00:04:24,579
<font color="#CCCCCC">that's why</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we have hatred and bigotry</font>

84
00:04:20,319 --> 00:04:27,009
and racism and prejudice because the

85
00:04:24,579 --> 00:04:28,959
more we can<font color="#E5E5E5"> create contracts and the</font>

86
00:04:27,009 --> 00:04:31,149
bigger the divided we could create<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

87
00:04:28,959 --> 00:04:33,589
more independent we feel this is why we

88
00:04:31,149 --> 00:04:36,649
don't have the love who's asking Bella

89
00:04:33,589 --> 00:04:39,259
because we're costly trying to sever and

90
00:04:36,649 --> 00:04:41,959
be independent really when it all comes

91
00:04:39,259 --> 00:04:44,569
down to it we're together but<font color="#CCCCCC"> anyway so</font>

92
00:04:41,959 --> 00:04:46,339
you do it with your father<font color="#E5E5E5"> and you'll do</font>

93
00:04:44,569 --> 00:04:48,560
with certain masters but<font color="#E5E5E5"> if it's a good</font>

94
00:04:46,339 --> 00:04:50,119
master you find night experience that

95
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:51,889
you come back and then it's like<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're</font>

96
00:04:50,120 --> 00:04:53,870
at a different level of your mastery and

97
00:04:51,889 --> 00:04:56,469
if that guy isn't true master it's funny

98
00:04:53,870 --> 00:04:59,689
you start to see some of the crazy shit

99
00:04:56,470 --> 00:05:01,640
