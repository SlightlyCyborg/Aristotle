been<font color="#E5E5E5"> hired for his first</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> full-time job</font>

3
00:00:04,650 --> 00:00:11,130
starts in a few days now<font color="#CCCCCC"> he's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> really</font>

4
00:00:06,870 --> 00:00:14,039
concerned because<font color="#E5E5E5"> tom has no skills he</font>

5
00:00:11,130 --> 00:00:16,170
really is at the bottom of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the barrel</font>

6
00:00:14,039 --> 00:00:18,809
when you know can with regard to

7
00:00:16,170 --> 00:00:20,039
seniority<font color="#E5E5E5"> and his new company and he's</font>

8
00:00:18,809 --> 00:00:22,799
little freaked out because he believes

9
00:00:20,039 --> 00:00:24,539
it in<font color="#E5E5E5"> this economy he can be laid off at</font>

10
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:26,750
any moment so he's wondering if he

11
00:00:24,539 --> 00:00:30,618
should rest all of his energy on

12
00:00:26,750 --> 00:00:32,700
pursuing and developing this career path

13
00:00:30,618 --> 00:00:34,979
knowing<font color="#E5E5E5"> that he's so vulnerable</font>

14
00:00:32,700 --> 00:00:39,059
especially since he doesn't have any

15
00:00:34,979 --> 00:00:40,890
real skills according to him so what

16
00:00:39,058 --> 00:00:45,299
should he do well here's a situation

17
00:00:40,890 --> 00:00:48,989
