00:00:37,738 --> 00:00:43,558
intermittent fast fast fast thing right

15
00:00:42,149 --> 00:00:47,189
I was gonna stop the video but fuck that

16
00:00:43,558 --> 00:00:50,849
that fasting fasting from you for making

17
00:00:47,189 --> 00:00:53,039
these videos right but instead of trying

18
00:00:50,850 --> 00:00:55,620
to catch<font color="#CCCCCC"> you up right</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> now I'm going to</font>

19
00:00:53,039 --> 00:00:57,929
give you some perspective on what's

20
00:00:55,619 --> 00:01:01,128
actually happening with all of us you

21
00:00:57,929 --> 00:01:05,099
know given my circumstances and<font color="#CCCCCC"> your</font>

22
00:01:01,128 --> 00:01:07,618
viewership yesterday I was reminded of a

23
00:01:05,099 --> 00:01:09,929
story my brother had me listen<font color="#CCCCCC"> to a Les</font>

24
00:01:07,618 --> 00:01:11,909
Brown video right those he was familiar

25
00:01:09,930 --> 00:01:14,250
with Les Brown he's a motivational

26
00:01:11,909 --> 00:01:16,049
speaker and one of the gifts that

27
00:01:14,250 --> 00:01:19,978
motivational speakers bring forth are

28
00:01:16,049 --> 00:01:23,479
wonderful parables metaphors and stories

29
00:01:19,978 --> 00:01:26,700
and Les Brown gave the good old bamboo

30
00:01:23,478 --> 00:01:28,618
growth story and for those you who are

31
00:01:26,700 --> 00:01:31,350
not familiar with it<font color="#E5E5E5"> i'll relate it to</font>

32
00:01:28,618 --> 00:01:35,129
you very briefly according<font color="#CCCCCC"> to National</font>

33
00:01:31,349 --> 00:01:37,199
Geographic the bamboo plant right when

34
00:01:35,129 --> 00:01:39,629
it is very young so<font color="#E5E5E5"> you've</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> got a little</font>

35
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:41,850

36
00:01:39,629 --> 00:01:46,289
earth<font color="#E5E5E5"> right it will say a particular</font>

37
00:01:41,849 --> 00:01:50,459
size right it will stay say six inches

38
00:01:46,290 --> 00:01:52,979
or a foot long foot tall for many many

39
00:01:50,459 --> 00:01:54,599
many years people will walk by and look

40
00:01:52,978 --> 00:01:56,819
at this thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> and think well it's not</font>

41
00:01:54,599 --> 00:01:59,929
doing anything right this plant is just

42
00:01:56,819 --> 00:02:03,298
the same<font color="#E5E5E5"> size it was two years ago</font>

43
00:01:59,930 --> 00:02:06,360
what's it doing well<font color="#E5E5E5"> underneath the</font>

44
00:02:03,299 --> 00:02:10,250
surface down below within the nourishing

confines and environment of the earth

46
00:02:10,250 --> 00:02:15,590
the

47
00:02:11,389 --> 00:02:20,599
roots of that bamboo plant are growing

48
00:02:15,590 --> 00:02:22,819
out growing deep and four years for many

49
00:02:20,599 --> 00:02:25,729
many years that plant stays the same

50
00:02:22,818 --> 00:02:29,689
size and it digs deep it goes deep it

51
00:02:25,729 --> 00:02:33,169
fulfills its foundation requirement its

52
00:02:29,689 --> 00:02:37,629
nutritional requirement it's going into

53
00:02:33,169 --> 00:02:43,339
<font color="#CCCCCC">the earth and then a funny thing happens</font>

54
00:02:37,629 --> 00:02:46,489
one day<font color="#E5E5E5"> the plant grows 90 feet tall in</font>

55
00:02:43,340 --> 00:02:50,870
a<font color="#E5E5E5"> matter of weeks it goes from being its</font>

00:02:46,489 --> 00:02:57,230
tiny self to a massive tall reaching for

we all grow stronger if you're going to

00:03:00,650 --> 00:03:06,650
ascend if you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to grow stronger</font>

61
00:03:06,650 --> 00:03:16,610
there will inevitably be times of going

62
00:03:10,759 --> 00:03:19,879
down deep in catalysis right it's this

63
00:03:16,610 --> 00:03:23,019
process of going down building more

64
00:03:19,879 --> 00:03:25,609
roots deeper roots stronger foundation

65
00:03:23,019 --> 00:03:27,829
right and you experience<font color="#E5E5E5"> this all</font>

66
00:03:25,610 --> 00:03:31,370
throughout your life you're constantly

<font color="#CCCCCC">doing this on a physical level and on a</font>

68
00:03:31,370 --> 00:03:37,969
metaphysical level right and as it

absolutely one hundred percent necessary

00:04:44,079 --> 00:04:48,788
getting into the earth of your body the

itself to ground yourself before you can

97
00:04:52,408 --> 00:04:56,079
skyrocket up just like that<font color="#E5E5E5"> bamboo</font>

planning that's what's going on<font color="#CCCCCC"> here</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">folks so you know what that all looks</font>

100
00:05:00,158 --> 00:05:06,158
like well it's easy<font color="#E5E5E5"> to look on the</font>

101
00:05:03,968 --> 00:05:09,038
surface to figure out what's really

102
00:05:06,158 --> 00:05:10,389
going on right I could spend the<font color="#E5E5E5"> next</font>

103
00:05:09,038 --> 00:05:12,579
well you know we're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be talking</font>

104
00:05:10,389 --> 00:05:16,598
<font color="#E5E5E5">for a little while here here so grab</font>

105
00:05:12,579 --> 00:05:19,329
yourself a drink I can talk 30 minutes

106
00:05:16,598 --> 00:05:22,240
about what I've been doing in that going

107
00:05:19,329 --> 00:05:25,658
down process<font color="#CCCCCC"> all right that digging deep</font>

108
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:28,478
process that growing roots process right

109
00:05:25,658 --> 00:05:32,668
but<font color="#CCCCCC"> that's very</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> subjective it's very</font>

110
00:05:28,478 --> 00:05:34,778
individual what's<font color="#E5E5E5"> required for you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

111
00:05:32,668 --> 00:05:37,538
become a stronger version of yourself

112
00:05:34,778 --> 00:05:40,389
those<font color="#E5E5E5"> things that you have to deal with</font>

113
00:05:37,538 --> 00:05:43,120
in the shadows deal with in the the dark

114
00:05:40,389 --> 00:05:45,610
deal with in the dirt deal with in the

115
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:47,649
soil your ground very subjective

116
00:05:45,610 --> 00:05:49,360
everybody's different<font color="#E5E5E5"> and if I were to</font>

117
00:05:47,649 --> 00:05:52,478
begin sharing what i've been doing what

118
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:55,419
I i hope most sound like Elliott's

119
00:05:52,478 --> 00:05:57,668
giving advice again<font color="#E5E5E5"> right I'm not here</font>

120
00:05:55,418 --> 00:05:59,948
<font color="#E5E5E5">to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> give advice I never really have been</font>

121
00:05:57,668 --> 00:06:01,329
here to give advice everything<font color="#CCCCCC"> that I've</font>

122
00:05:59,949 --> 00:06:03,300
offered you through these videos has

123
00:06:01,329 --> 00:06:07,228
been a matter<font color="#E5E5E5"> of my experience and my</font>

124
00:06:03,300 --> 00:06:09,370
sharing what his work best for<font color="#CCCCCC"> me right</font>

125
00:06:07,228 --> 00:06:12,158
there's a good chance that i'll probably

126
00:06:09,370 --> 00:06:14,978
be back with more<font color="#CCCCCC"> videos but guess what</font>

127
00:06:12,158 --> 00:06:18,278
<font color="#CCCCCC">i will have that much more experience</font>

128
00:06:14,978 --> 00:06:21,149
that much more depth of self<font color="#E5E5E5"> and content</font>

129
00:06:18,278 --> 00:06:26,319
to share with you when<font color="#E5E5E5"> i decide to do it</font>

130
00:06:21,149 --> 00:06:29,138
right so like I alluded to the best way

131
00:06:26,319 --> 00:06:32,740
to know what's<font color="#CCCCCC"> going on inside</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> someone</font>

132
00:06:29,139 --> 00:06:35,629
is to look at the outside right the best

133
00:06:32,740 --> 00:06:37,430
way to know someone's the depths of

134
00:06:35,629 --> 00:06:39,500
one character someone's characters to

135
00:06:37,430 --> 00:06:43,490
look at you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> what's going on in the</font>

136
00:06:39,500 --> 00:06:45,649
outside right so let's talk a little bit

137
00:06:43,490 --> 00:06:48,740
about what's happening on<font color="#E5E5E5"> the outside</font>

138
00:06:45,649 --> 00:06:50,889
the most obvious manifestations of my

139
00:06:48,740 --> 00:06:54,530
process and our relationship together

140
00:06:50,889 --> 00:06:57,560
one of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> things for sure is that with</font>

141
00:06:54,529 --> 00:07:00,739
a going down<font color="#E5E5E5"> there's a subsequent going</font>

142
00:06:57,560 --> 00:07:02,810
up right<font color="#CCCCCC"> I said to someone very recently</font>

143
00:07:00,740 --> 00:07:04,519
that your life is often like a

144
00:07:02,810 --> 00:07:06,470
basketball right you want you're going

145
00:07:04,519 --> 00:07:08,509
to bounce that basket ball up high yes

146
00:07:06,470 --> 00:07:11,540
and that shit down really hard the

149
00:07:15,829 --> 00:07:25,240
<font color="#E5E5E5">just like the friggin basketball just</font>

150
00:07:18,769 --> 00:07:25,240
like the bamboo plant I need some water

151
00:07:37,810 --> 00:07:45,019
good so let's continue our conversation

152
00:07:42,230 --> 00:07:48,379
<font color="#CCCCCC">with regard to what that bouncing up or</font>

153
00:07:45,019 --> 00:07:51,109
with that skyrocketing growth looks like

154
00:07:48,379 --> 00:07:57,980
right what that bamboo looks like for

155
00:07:51,110 --> 00:08:01,009
one strengthcamp jim has evolved leaps

156
00:07:57,980 --> 00:08:03,439
and bounds over the past two<font color="#CCCCCC"> years shred</font>

157
00:08:01,009 --> 00:08:05,539
camp jim has gone from my warehouse gym

158
00:08:03,439 --> 00:08:06,949
<font color="#E5E5E5">in the south side of st. Pete where we</font>

159
00:08:05,540 --> 00:08:11,150
at<font color="#E5E5E5"> crafts crack heads and prostitutes</font>

160
00:08:06,949 --> 00:08:13,819
right to the little studio that I had on

161
00:08:11,149 --> 00:08:16,729
<font color="#E5E5E5">Haynes road where most of you got to</font>

162
00:08:13,819 --> 00:08:21,889

163
00:08:16,730 --> 00:08:24,500
video presenter for 23 years I<font color="#E5E5E5"> made</font>

164
00:08:21,889 --> 00:08:31,000
videos lots of videos tons of<font color="#E5E5E5"> them just</font>

165
00:08:24,500 --> 00:08:35,599
feeding into the camera right and then I

166
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:38,059
decided circumstances were such that it

167
00:08:35,599 --> 00:08:42,080
was time<font color="#E5E5E5"> to go back and grow</font>

168
00:08:38,059 --> 00:08:45,669
strengthcamp gym right strengthcamp gym

169
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:47,950
is displayed in the new video

170
00:08:45,669 --> 00:08:50,079
that you see with our coaches at the gym

171
00:08:47,950 --> 00:08:52,060
<font color="#E5E5E5">the things that we're doing the members</font>

172
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:53,860
that we have we never had any members at

173
00:08:52,059 --> 00:08:57,399
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> second stripe camp is also busy</font>

174
00:08:53,860 --> 00:08:59,230
making these videos right what I set out

175
00:08:57,399 --> 00:09:02,079
to do from the beginning was to build a

176
00:08:59,230 --> 00:09:03,340
gym to have<font color="#CCCCCC"> a strength camp right that's</font>

177
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:06,250
<font color="#E5E5E5">what I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that's what this has been about</font>

178
00:09:03,340 --> 00:09:09,250
from the beginning right I decided to

179
00:09:06,250 --> 00:09:10,929
dedicate a few years<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> my life to</font>

180
00:09:09,250 --> 00:09:14,049
sharing through this camera but

181
00:09:10,929 --> 00:09:16,419
ultimately the goal has been and is

182
00:09:14,049 --> 00:09:19,029
being achieved that strength camp grows

183
00:09:16,419 --> 00:09:20,409
up Shrek camp is<font color="#E5E5E5"> not only grown up in</font>

184
00:09:19,029 --> 00:09:23,679

camera I get robbed that<font color="#E5E5E5"> the love return</font>

00:19:41,730 --> 00:19:46,779
the return right remember<font color="#CCCCCC"> mine</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> on job</font>

433
00:19:44,710 --> 00:19:47,548
video you put out that love the love

434
00:19:46,779 --> 00:19:50,278
comes back

435
00:19:47,548 --> 00:19:53,190
I've gotten to look back monetarily but

436
00:19:50,278 --> 00:19:58,679
that means nothing compared to the love

437
00:19:53,190 --> 00:20:00,389
back<font color="#CCCCCC"> in heart and soul I can't make</font>

438

videos for rest<font color="#E5E5E5"> of my life and hope</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

439
00:20:00,388 --> 00:20:06,178
have that heart and soul connection<font color="#CCCCCC"> yeah</font>

440
00:20:03,509 --> 00:20:09,179
if it<font color="#E5E5E5"> sounds like I'm justifying well</font>

441
00:20:06,179 --> 00:20:11,399
maybe I<font color="#CCCCCC"> am past</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> two years has been a</font>

442
00:20:09,179 --> 00:20:14,759
<font color="#E5E5E5">process of me trying to figure out who I</font>

443
00:20:11,398 --> 00:20:17,969
<font color="#E5E5E5">am what I'm really put here to do and to</font>

444
00:20:14,759 --> 00:20:19,440
live my authentic self and it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> very</font>

445
00:20:17,970 --> 00:20:21,659
difficult for a lot of people to be able

446
00:20:19,440 --> 00:20:23,929
to realize that especially those who

447
00:20:21,659 --> 00:20:28,019
have<font color="#E5E5E5"> come to be fed from these videos</font>

448
00:20:23,929 --> 00:20:29,940
there's a lesson in that also for you if

449
00:20:28,019 --> 00:20:33,450
you've watched my videos while I was

450
00:20:29,940 --> 00:20:36,419
<font color="#E5E5E5">feeding you and you became addicted</font>

451
00:20:33,450 --> 00:20:39,778
right sucking on it sucking it all in

452
00:20:36,419 --> 00:20:42,299
and when I pull off if you have a hard

453
00:20:39,778 --> 00:20:44,788
<font color="#E5E5E5">time grounding yourself without me</font>

454
00:20:42,298 --> 00:20:47,690
feeding you without you latching on to

455
00:20:44,788 --> 00:20:50,158
me then you've got a lot of work to do

456
00:20:47,690 --> 00:20:53,999
when you could stand<font color="#E5E5E5"> on your own feet</font>

457
00:20:50,159 --> 00:20:58,710
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> not have that oral desire to suck on</font>

458
00:20:53,999 --> 00:20:59,970
to consume it'll be a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> easier</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> number</font>

one for<font color="#E5E5E5"> you to live an authentic life</font>

460
00:20:59,970 --> 00:21:05,100
but number two to allow other people to

461
00:21:02,249 --> 00:21:07,409
live their authentic lives<font color="#E5E5E5"> alright I get</font>

462
00:21:05,099 --> 00:21:09,738
it I get up I get it there's a pattern

463
00:21:07,409 --> 00:21:12,570
interrupt there's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> little disrupt</font>

464
00:21:09,739 --> 00:21:14,129
there's some confusion about it and I

465
00:21:12,569 --> 00:21:19,439
haven't<font color="#CCCCCC"> been</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> on drip sent transparent</font>

466
00:21:14,128 --> 00:21:21,329
because I<font color="#E5E5E5"> just needed to go in so the</font>

467
00:21:19,440 --> 00:21:23,570
lesson here for those of you<font color="#E5E5E5"> who are</font>

468
00:21:21,329 --> 00:21:28,648
latched on and who<font color="#E5E5E5"> have had a hard time</font>

469
00:21:23,569 --> 00:21:31,288
with my disappearance it's an

470
00:21:28,648 --> 00:21:34,018
opportunity<font color="#E5E5E5"> to learn how to integrate</font>

471
00:21:31,288 --> 00:21:36,419
the things I've spoken about to be<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

472
00:21:34,019 --> 00:21:37,769
thing rather than consuming we're all

473
00:21:36,419 --> 00:21:41,669
consumers we live in this goddamn

474
00:21:37,769 --> 00:21:43,470
consumer machine matrix all you do is

475
00:21:41,669 --> 00:21:44,759
consume consume consume all day long on

476
00:21:43,470 --> 00:21:46,288
the phone all day long on the computer

477
00:21:44,759 --> 00:21:47,368
sucking and sucking and sucking and

478
00:21:46,288 --> 00:21:49,408
thinking<font color="#E5E5E5"> that you're</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> learning something</font>

479
00:21:47,368 --> 00:21:53,308
but<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're really just filling your head</font>

480
00:21:49,409 --> 00:21:55,409
because nothing is embodied if you want

481
00:21:53,308 --> 00:21:57,329
a true gift you want<font color="#E5E5E5"> the real gift of a</font>

482
00:21:55,409 --> 00:21:59,200
late houses videos watch one of my

483
00:21:57,329 --> 00:22:03,099
videos and go do the thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> that I was</font>

484
00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:06,460
talking<font color="#E5E5E5"> about on your own feet on your</font>

485
00:22:03,099 --> 00:22:10,750
own ground in your own way and get off

486
00:22:06,460 --> 00:22:14,558
the tip and finally speaking of

487
00:22:10,750 --> 00:22:18,429
grounding one of the my most proud

488
00:22:14,558 --> 00:22:21,069
projects the one by which<font color="#E5E5E5"> I now have the</font>

489
00:22:18,429 --> 00:22:28,028
space the creativity the authenticity

490
00:22:21,069 --> 00:22:30,908
and the courage to walk forward with and

491
00:22:28,028 --> 00:22:36,038
to carry and to enter and to develop as

492
00:22:30,909 --> 00:22:40,000
a gift is grounding camps drowning camp

493
00:22:36,038 --> 00:22:44,398
is my new company where we do camps that

494
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:47,859
offer<font color="#CCCCCC"> osho dynamic meditations and</font>

495
00:22:44,398 --> 00:22:49,629
bioenergetic grounding those use watch

496
00:22:47,859 --> 00:22:51,189
my videos long enough knew that this was

497
00:22:49,630 --> 00:22:53,500
a part of what Elliott Hulse wanted to

498
00:22:51,190 --> 00:22:55,179
offer to<font color="#E5E5E5"> the world I've had to do a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> lot</font>

499
00:22:53,500 --> 00:22:57,730
of soul-searching a lot of dig deep

500
00:22:55,179 --> 00:23:01,480
digging inside to figure out how I'm

501
00:22:57,730 --> 00:23:03,278
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to offer that right I I got a lot</font>

502
00:23:01,480 --> 00:23:05,288
of resistance I got a lot of love

503
00:23:03,278 --> 00:23:07,388
because<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the videos that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> introduced</font>

504
00:23:05,288 --> 00:23:10,240
bioenergetics and active meditation but

505
00:23:07,388 --> 00:23:12,699
<font color="#E5E5E5">I also got a mere reflection of my</font>

506
00:23:10,240 --> 00:23:16,058
shadow self by those of those people who

507
00:23:12,700 --> 00:23:18,250
want to denigrate Elliott Hulse for

508
00:23:16,058 --> 00:23:20,849
those ideas I really had to step back

509
00:23:18,250 --> 00:23:23,679
and say am I am<font color="#CCCCCC"> I real or am I wrong</font>

510
00:23:20,849 --> 00:23:26,259
well guess what round the camp LLC means

511
00:23:23,679 --> 00:23:29,798
Elliott Hulse is real about this we're

512
00:23:26,259 --> 00:23:32,440
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> on the fourth camp which sells out</font>

513
00:23:29,798 --> 00:23:34,569
everything that<font color="#CCCCCC"> we've done has sold out</font>

514
00:23:32,440 --> 00:23:36,669
within less than two weeks for grounding

515
00:23:34,569 --> 00:23:41,079
kit we do<font color="#E5E5E5"> buy out bioenergetics dynamic</font>

516
00:23:36,669 --> 00:23:44,700
meditation and in fact<font color="#E5E5E5"> I will be in an</font>

strada<font color="#E5E5E5"> Amsterdam right I'm dehydrated</font>

518
00:23:44,700 --> 00:23:48,490
probably because I'm a little<font color="#E5E5E5"> nervous I</font>

519
00:23:46,690 --> 00:23:54,870
haven't spoken to guys like this<font color="#E5E5E5"> they're</font>

00:23:48,490 --> 00:23:59,370
with me it's been a while

bioenergetics and dynamic meditation and

00:24:09,539 --> 00:24:18,509
offering a life changing world embracing

526
00:24:15,690 --> 00:24:23,430
vision that I've reconnected with and

527
00:24:18,509 --> 00:24:26,869
that I want to share with you if there's

528

there are new tools<font color="#E5E5E5"> and techniques and</font>

532
00:24:36,740 --> 00:24:41,940
that's what I want<font color="#CCCCCC"> to move forward</font>

received and will continue to receive

539
00:24:55,289 --> 00:25:00,720
because of our relationship I don't take

00:24:57,058 --> 00:25:04,230
it<font color="#CCCCCC"> for granted what I do have to create</font>

541
00:25:00,720 --> 00:25:06,480
boundaries for myself and you to learn

542
00:25:04,230 --> 00:25:10,200
<font color="#CCCCCC">to create and respect boundaries in your</font>
