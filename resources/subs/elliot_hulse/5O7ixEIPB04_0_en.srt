2
00:00:09,599 --> 00:00:14,730
question from one of our strength camp

3
00:00:11,128 --> 00:00:16,980
online members Julian since both<font color="#E5E5E5"> of my</font>

4
00:00:14,730 --> 00:00:18,330
boys are following in my footsteps I've

5
00:00:16,980 --> 00:00:21,929
<font color="#E5E5E5">been lifting weights with me for two</font>

6
00:00:18,329 --> 00:00:24,449
<font color="#E5E5E5">months now</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Ali is 15 and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Jack is 14</font>

7
00:00:21,929 --> 00:00:26,399
pretty good I'm<font color="#CCCCCC"> very proud of them and</font>

8
00:00:24,449 --> 00:00:29,250
they're making<font color="#CCCCCC"> some good games but I</font>

9
00:00:26,399 --> 00:00:31,439
want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to check to see if I need to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> be</font>

10
00:00:29,250 --> 00:00:34,768
<font color="#E5E5E5">more cautious with them since they're</font>

11
00:00:31,440 --> 00:00:37,820
not yet fully grown adults you give<font color="#E5E5E5"> me</font>

12
00:00:34,768 --> 00:00:40,469
some<font color="#CCCCCC"> advice on the matter please so uh</font>

13
00:00:37,820 --> 00:00:42,600
Thank<font color="#CCCCCC"> You Julian that's a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> great question</font>

14
00:00:40,469 --> 00:00:45,510
interestingly enough i began weight

15
00:00:42,600 --> 00:00:47,550
training when i was 14 years old and i

16
00:00:45,509 --> 00:00:49,768
would give<font color="#E5E5E5"> you the same advice that I</font>

17
00:00:47,549 --> 00:00:51,808
would give any adult that's training

18
00:00:49,768 --> 00:00:54,088
right now and<font color="#CCCCCC"> that is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> not to get too</font>

19
00:00:51,808 --> 00:00:56,428
caught up into fixed patterns of

20
00:00:54,088 --> 00:00:58,829
training and and this could be with

21
00:00:56,429 --> 00:01:00,629
regard to sports and it could<font color="#CCCCCC"> be with</font>

22
00:00:58,829 --> 00:01:03,838
regard to training in the gym because

23
00:01:00,628 --> 00:01:04,798
<font color="#CCCCCC">often times I see these young men come</font>

24
00:01:03,838 --> 00:01:07,200
in here and they've been playing

25
00:01:04,799 --> 00:01:09,450
baseball say for example since there

26
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:11,549
were seven years old and what I<font color="#E5E5E5"> mean by</font>

27
00:01:09,450 --> 00:01:14,520
fixed pattern is that they keep<font color="#E5E5E5"> doing</font>

28
00:01:11,549 --> 00:01:17,909
the same movement over and over and over

29
00:01:14,519 --> 00:01:19,859
<font color="#E5E5E5">and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> over</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> again for seven years they show</font>

30
00:01:17,909 --> 00:01:21,719
up here<font color="#E5E5E5"> and they look like this you know</font>

31
00:01:19,859 --> 00:01:23,789
the arm is immediately rotated one hip

32
00:01:21,718 --> 00:01:25,709
is rotated forward and that shoulders

33
00:01:23,789 --> 00:01:28,140
hiked up and then there you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

34
00:01:25,709 --> 00:01:29,578
parents like well here is he's got<font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font>

35
00:01:28,140 --> 00:01:31,170
he's gonna lift some weights and gain

36
00:01:29,578 --> 00:01:34,559
<font color="#CCCCCC">some muscle and I'm looking at the kid</font>

37
00:01:31,170 --> 00:01:36,780
and I'm like.he his biology is a

38
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:39,299
<font color="#E5E5E5">mechanics or so off because he's been</font>

39
00:01:36,780 --> 00:01:41,310
performing these fixed patterns right

40
00:01:39,299 --> 00:01:44,159
pattern overload doing the same thing

41
00:01:41,310 --> 00:01:48,149
<font color="#CCCCCC">over and over and over and over</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> again to</font>

42
00:01:44,159 --> 00:01:50,189
such a degree that now he has chronic

43
00:01:48,149 --> 00:01:52,259
muscular imbalances he's constantly

44
00:01:50,188 --> 00:01:54,478
getting injuries he's<font color="#E5E5E5"> definitely not</font>

45
00:01:52,259 --> 00:01:57,760
performing at<font color="#E5E5E5"> his best and I think this</font>

46
00:01:54,478 --> 00:02:01,439
<font color="#E5E5E5">could be averted if all of us should</font>

47
00:01:57,760 --> 00:02:04,210
but the clothes on me if all<font color="#CCCCCC"> of us</font>

48
00:02:01,439 --> 00:02:06,009
starting at a very early training age

49
00:02:04,209 --> 00:02:08,799
training age meeting when<font color="#CCCCCC"> you start</font>

50
00:02:06,010 --> 00:02:11,680
training integrate and incorporate

51
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:14,050
multiple ranges of motion into our

52
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:16,120
routine so if you've got<font color="#E5E5E5"> your boys</font>

53
00:02:14,050 --> 00:02:18,040
<font color="#E5E5E5">bodybuilding that's great they should be</font>

54
00:02:16,120 --> 00:02:20,920
<font color="#CCCCCC">building up their muscles getting bigger</font>

55
00:02:18,039 --> 00:02:23,169
and stronger but<font color="#E5E5E5"> also include days where</font>

56
00:02:20,919 --> 00:02:25,269
they're doing gymnastics or days where

57
00:02:23,169 --> 00:02:28,299
they're<font color="#CCCCCC"> doing yoga that's what I do now</font>

58
00:02:25,270 --> 00:02:30,550
I don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> weight train exclusively without</font>

59
00:02:28,300 --> 00:02:33,040
integrating some yoga into<font color="#E5E5E5"> my training</font>

60
00:02:30,550 --> 00:02:34,780
about three days a week I do yoga I put

61
00:02:33,039 --> 00:02:36,609
on some yoga videos or some great one on

62
00:02:34,780 --> 00:02:39,640
<font color="#E5E5E5">YouTube and there are some great DVDs</font>

63
00:02:36,610 --> 00:02:41,590
just<font color="#E5E5E5"> by a yoga DVD and athletic yoga DVD</font>

64
00:02:39,639 --> 00:02:44,139
fact one of my friends just sent me a

65
00:02:41,590 --> 00:02:45,129
book called real men do yoga and on it

66
00:02:44,139 --> 00:02:47,469
as a professional football player

67
00:02:45,129 --> 00:02:50,349
sitting cross-legged and I think the

68
00:02:47,469 --> 00:02:52,539
<font color="#E5E5E5">reason why real men do yoga is because</font>

69
00:02:50,349 --> 00:02:56,019
it keeps them healthy strong vibrant and

70
00:02:52,539 --> 00:02:58,569
vital without injury and continuing<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

71
00:02:56,020 --> 00:03:00,130
progress on<font color="#E5E5E5"> their journey without a you</font>

72
00:02:58,569 --> 00:03:01,870
know all the crap that people end up

73
00:03:00,129 --> 00:03:04,840
dealing with<font color="#E5E5E5"> in surgeries and whatnot</font>

74
00:03:01,870 --> 00:03:06,099
because<font color="#CCCCCC"> of poor training routines so</font>

75
00:03:04,840 --> 00:03:07,750
keep doing<font color="#CCCCCC"> what you're doing man I think</font>

76
00:03:06,099 --> 00:03:09,759
<font color="#CCCCCC">it's a fantastic job that you got your</font>

77
00:03:07,750 --> 00:03:13,509
<font color="#CCCCCC">boys training I began training when I</font>

78
00:03:09,759 --> 00:03:16,479
was 14 years old but integrate multiple

79
00:03:13,509 --> 00:03:18,250
range of motion explosive and<font color="#CCCCCC"> just</font>

80
00:03:16,479 --> 00:03:19,599
different elements of training into

81
00:03:18,250 --> 00:03:21,939
their routine so don't they<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't get</font>

82
00:03:19,599 --> 00:03:23,829
fixed into these these<font color="#CCCCCC"> stuff</font>

83
00:03:21,939 --> 00:03:26,620
bodybuilding patterns where they end up

84
00:03:23,830 --> 00:03:29,650
with really tight biceps tight shoulders

85
00:03:26,620 --> 00:03:32,739
and screwed up bodies when they're 25

86
00:03:29,650 --> 00:03:35,400
see what I'm saying man done<font color="#CCCCCC"> Elliott's</font>
