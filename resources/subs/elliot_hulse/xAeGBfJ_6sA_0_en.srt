00:00:00,050 --> 00:00:04,200
this is my answer for almost everything

2
00:00:02,428 --> 00:00:06,628
and I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> going</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to sound funny</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> saying it</font>

3
00:00:04,200 --> 00:00:07,710
but breathe into your balls you're going

4
00:00:06,628 --> 00:00:09,089
to learn how to breathe into our balls

5
00:00:07,710 --> 00:00:11,460
and that basically<font color="#E5E5E5"> means we've</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> got to</font>

8
00:00:13,468 --> 00:00:17,669
it that prison manifests itself in the

neurotic holding patterns that I

10
00:00:17,670 --> 00:00:22,590
<font color="#E5E5E5">mentioned before that do not allow us to</font>

go out and do all these things they see

45
00:01:44,950 --> 00:01:48,969
us doing in our videos but when we meet

46
00:01:47,290 --> 00:01:50,770
them a<font color="#E5E5E5"> person a lot then those are</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

00:01:50,769 --> 00:01:55,569
they<font color="#CCCCCC"> got their satisfaction writing it</font>

49
00:01:53,500 --> 00:01:59,170
out rather than that it's like yeah they

50
00:01:55,569 --> 00:02:00,789
did an amazing trend yeah<font color="#CCCCCC"> absolutely</font>

51
00:01:59,170 --> 00:02:02,680
because they did in their mind they

52
00:02:00,790 --> 00:02:04,540
actually already did that we like to

53
00:02:02,680 --> 00:02:06,070
<font color="#E5E5E5">think and we like</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to talk because that's</font>

54
00:02:04,540 --> 00:02:08,710
what<font color="#CCCCCC"> how we've been taught in schools in</font>

55
00:02:06,069 --> 00:02:11,709
schools we've been taught that it is

56
00:02:08,710 --> 00:02:13,810
virtuous to think a lot and have the

57
00:02:11,710 --> 00:02:15,310
right answer raise your hand so people

58
00:02:13,810 --> 00:02:17,140
<font color="#CCCCCC">go about their lives thinking and</font>

59
00:02:15,310 --> 00:02:20,080
talking<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know what they do in schools</font>

60
00:02:17,139 --> 00:02:22,179
out there's no fizzy they've cut back on

61
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:23,709
physical education and they cut back<font color="#E5E5E5"> on</font>

62
00:02:22,180 --> 00:02:25,420
the amount of time that kids get to<font color="#E5E5E5"> go</font>

63
00:02:23,709 --> 00:02:27,099
outside for recess but<font color="#CCCCCC"> you know</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> what</font>

64
00:02:25,419 --> 00:02:29,349
they're doing more of thinking and

65
00:02:27,099 --> 00:02:31,629
talking we've been<font color="#E5E5E5"> conditioned this way</font>

66
00:02:29,349 --> 00:02:33,759
it's true man I agree<font color="#CCCCCC"> if you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> lie the</font>

67
00:02:31,629 --> 00:02:35,469
cultural conditioning today is kind of

68
00:02:33,759 --> 00:02:37,389
bass ackwards but<font color="#E5E5E5"> I always think of the</font>

69
00:02:35,469 --> 00:02:39,129
analogy of how everyone's like so

70
00:02:37,389 --> 00:02:42,039
concerned about eating factory farmed

71
00:02:39,129 --> 00:02:44,889
animals and like we need free range and

72
00:02:42,039 --> 00:02:45,969
wild fed and like and I really when you

73
00:02:44,889 --> 00:02:47,259
look at<font color="#CCCCCC"> it when</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you look at our school</font>

74
00:02:45,969 --> 00:02:49,479
system when you<font color="#E5E5E5"> look at the food we're</font>

75
00:02:47,259 --> 00:02:51,909
fed and these pills that kids get put on

76
00:02:49,479 --> 00:02:54,939
it's like in a way the human<font color="#E5E5E5"> race is the</font>

77
00:02:51,909 --> 00:02:56,889
biggest factory farmed animal oh wow

78
00:02:54,939 --> 00:02:59,500
that's so funny you're right we really

79
00:02:56,889 --> 00:03:01,119
<font color="#E5E5E5">are you're</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> six years old but you're</font>

80
00:02:59,500 --> 00:03:03,849
being judged on how well you sit down

81
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:06,159
<font color="#E5E5E5">shut up and follow directions so you're</font>

82
00:03:03,849 --> 00:03:11,229
literally literally creating a crop up

83
00:03:06,159 --> 00:03:12,549
children and adults who have no no

84
00:03:11,229 --> 00:03:16,389
permission they're looking for

85
00:03:12,550 --> 00:03:18,219
permission how do you recommend people

86
00:03:16,389 --> 00:03:20,979
recovering from that like it's stopped

87
00:03:18,219 --> 00:03:22,719
reading stop stop stop studying stop

88
00:03:20,979 --> 00:03:24,189

93
00:03:30,520 --> 00:03:35,409
people again they feel comforted by the

94
00:03:33,849 --> 00:03:37,060
fact that they they watch the video

95
00:03:35,409 --> 00:03:38,530

144
00:05:21,910 --> 00:05:26,470
to get<font color="#E5E5E5"> in shape where they go to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the gym</font>

145
00:05:22,959 --> 00:05:29,439
it's just as stupid you do it so<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

146
00:05:26,470 --> 00:05:30,880
you have<font color="#CCCCCC"> the power to do it yeah</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

147
00:05:29,439 --> 00:05:32,560
that big on top of that code I think

148
00:05:30,879 --> 00:05:34,620
there's one from Albert Einstein about

149
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:38,259
nothing happens until something moves

150
00:05:34,620 --> 00:05:41,560
absolutely man good boy none of us are

151
00:05:38,259 --> 00:05:43,449
any of this you're not what your skin

152
00:05:41,560 --> 00:05:45,879
reveals you're not your bone and flesh

153
00:05:43,449 --> 00:05:48,909
you're not your name you're not your

154
00:05:45,879 --> 00:05:52,300
ideas you are so<font color="#E5E5E5"> much more than that I</font>

155
00:05:48,910 --> 00:05:54,310
think<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> more of a trusting the</font>

156
00:05:52,300 --> 00:05:56,770
brilliance in your body trusting that

157
00:05:54,310 --> 00:05:58,089
part of<font color="#E5E5E5"> your brain that part of you that</font>

158
00:05:56,769 --> 00:05:59,680
beats your heart without me having to

159
00:05:58,089 --> 00:06:01,119
think about it that part of you that

160
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:03,129
grows a baby in a woman's stomach

161
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:06,310
without our having to do it<font color="#E5E5E5"> the part of</font>

162
00:06:03,129 --> 00:06:08,199
<font color="#CCCCCC">you that replaces cells all over the</font>

163
00:06:06,310 --> 00:06:10,030
place without<font color="#E5E5E5"> you having to do</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> your at</font>

164
00:06:08,199 --> 00:06:11,620
replacing your<font color="#CCCCCC"> settle who's doing it</font>

165
00:06:10,029 --> 00:06:13,299
it's that brilliant party you deep down

166
00:06:11,620 --> 00:06:15,519
within your peripheral nervous system

167
00:06:13,300 --> 00:06:17,410
when we breathe deep we're honoring that

168
00:06:15,519 --> 00:06:20,709
peripheral nervous system that's when

169
00:06:17,410 --> 00:06:22,480
the shut comes out oh do you have any of

170
00:06:20,709 --> 00:06:25,989
you have any screams that you do or any

171
00:06:22,480 --> 00:06:28,180
kind of things in the gym where<font color="#CCCCCC"> we were</font>

172
00:06:25,990 --> 00:06:30,150
trying to tap into that<font color="#E5E5E5"> that extra push</font>

173
00:06:28,180 --> 00:06:33,360
that you do to get yourself fired up

174
00:06:30,149 --> 00:06:37,029
there are two exercises that are

175
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:38,800
magnificently powerful for unleashing

176
00:06:37,029 --> 00:06:41,139
your motility but they're<font color="#CCCCCC"> very different</font>

177
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:43,900
they're strange in fact that<font color="#E5E5E5"> there are</font>

178
00:06:41,139 --> 00:06:46,029
three they kind of like build on top of

179
00:06:43,899 --> 00:06:47,248
each<font color="#E5E5E5"> other something</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> very similar but it</font>

180
00:06:46,029 --> 00:06:49,278
looks like<font color="#E5E5E5"> this Oh</font>

181
00:06:47,249 --> 00:06:49,278
Oh

182
00:06:57,649 --> 00:07:02,299
this is where our ego is right our ego

183
00:06:59,930 --> 00:07:04,810
right gift so the morning come<font color="#E5E5E5"> at your</font>

184
00:07:02,300 --> 00:07:04,810
face though
