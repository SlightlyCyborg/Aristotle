1
00:00:00,800 --> 00:00:05,219
most of the times when you decide that

2
00:00:02,879 --> 00:00:06,960
you want to live in a different<font color="#E5E5E5"> way or</font>

3
00:00:05,219 --> 00:00:08,699
achieve different goals or have

4
00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:10,650
different values from the<font color="#CCCCCC"> majority of</font>

5
00:00:08,699 --> 00:00:12,449
people what<font color="#E5E5E5"> you got to realize is that</font>

6
00:00:10,650 --> 00:00:14,298
you've<font color="#CCCCCC"> got</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to do things that the</font>

7
00:00:12,449 --> 00:00:16,230
majority of people<font color="#E5E5E5"> aren't willing to do</font>

8
00:00:14,298 --> 00:00:18,778
right that means you've got to step

9
00:00:16,230 --> 00:00:20,820
outside the bounds of the traditional

10
00:00:18,778 --> 00:00:22,198
ways of life so for example but I

11
00:00:20,820 --> 00:00:25,528
decided that I want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> own my own</font>

12
00:00:22,199 --> 00:00:28,650
business right<font color="#E5E5E5"> I had to quit working for</font>

13
00:00:25,528 --> 00:00:31,109
someone else because freedom is one of

14
00:00:28,649 --> 00:00:32,789
my highest values I realized that I was

15
00:00:31,109 --> 00:00:36,929
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to have to give</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> up this idea of</font>

16
00:00:32,789 --> 00:00:39,420
security and in that I allowed myself to

17
00:00:36,929 --> 00:00:42,378
explore what the absolute worst could

18
00:00:39,420 --> 00:00:45,780
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> could happen if I allowed myself to</font>

19
00:00:42,378 --> 00:00:48,899
to participate in<font color="#E5E5E5"> my desire to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> go</font>

20
00:00:45,780 --> 00:00:51,570
towards living that lifestyle and the

21
00:00:48,899 --> 00:00:54,359
thing I thought of was look I've got

22
00:00:51,570 --> 00:00:55,859
children that need to eat and and I've

23
00:00:54,359 --> 00:01:00,119
got a roof that needs to be put over my

24
00:00:55,859 --> 00:01:01,590
head and I decided that that if<font color="#E5E5E5"> things</font>

25
00:01:00,119 --> 00:01:03,959
didn't work out i<font color="#E5E5E5"> would go pick oranges</font>

26
00:01:01,590 --> 00:01:06,810
now i live in florida and there is day

27
00:01:03,960 --> 00:01:07,920
labor so I had a phone number for a day

28
00:01:06,810 --> 00:01:10,890
laborer company i think it was called

29
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:12,240
<font color="#E5E5E5">able body in my pocket at all times</font>

30
00:01:10,890 --> 00:01:14,070
because I knew that if I couldn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> make</font>

31
00:01:12,239 --> 00:01:16,618
things happen with my business<font color="#E5E5E5"> I wasn't</font>

32
00:01:14,069 --> 00:01:18,899
going back to a career job I was<font color="#E5E5E5"> gonna</font>

33
00:01:16,618 --> 00:01:20,609
do what I had to do in order to just put

34
00:01:18,900 --> 00:01:22,439
food in mouth and if that meant I'm

35
00:01:20,609 --> 00:01:24,599
gonna go do be a day laborer that was

36
00:01:22,438 --> 00:01:27,059
fine because I saw that as a means to<font color="#CCCCCC"> an</font>

37
00:01:24,599 --> 00:01:28,978
end most careers end up being an end in

38
00:01:27,060 --> 00:01:30,900
themselves but if you for me to pick

39
00:01:28,978 --> 00:01:32,400
oranges to me to an end the other thing

40
00:01:30,900 --> 00:01:35,009
<font color="#CCCCCC">is that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> if I couldn't pay my mortgage I</font>
