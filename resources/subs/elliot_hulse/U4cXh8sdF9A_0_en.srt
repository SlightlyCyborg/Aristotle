00:00:02,220 --> 00:00:08,189
for a living you are a leader to someone

00:00:04,950 --> 00:00:10,080
in your life you may<font color="#E5E5E5"> not have the stated</font>

position of a leader but there are

<font color="#CCCCCC">people that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> look to you for guidance or</font>

in<font color="#E5E5E5"> different categories of their life</font>

who have accepted the responsibility of

leadership if you're a parent you've

leadership if you're in a managerial

have accepted<font color="#CCCCCC"> the responsibility of</font>

00:00:56,128 --> 00:01:01,679
that there's a totally different set of

27
00:00:58,439 --> 00:01:03,358
pressures that are set on you right

28
00:01:01,679 --> 00:01:04,920
<font color="#E5E5E5">because now you're aware of the fact</font>

people or the depth of support you're

providing for people parents know this

teachers know this leaders in every

realm understand this but there comes a

39
00:01:31,109 --> 00:01:38,849
time when every single<font color="#CCCCCC"> leader doesn't</font>

40

want his leadership there comes a time

41
00:01:38,849 --> 00:01:44,789
when a leader says I don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> want this</font>

42
00:01:41,540 --> 00:01:47,909
what did I create why do these people

43
00:01:44,790 --> 00:01:52,189
lean on me how can I now continue to

44
00:01:47,909 --> 00:01:55,320
support them even when I feel weak all

45
00:01:52,188 --> 00:01:58,438
leaders go through this<font color="#E5E5E5"> and the reason</font>

46
00:01:55,319 --> 00:02:00,359
<font color="#CCCCCC">why I know is because I study the</font>

00:02:10,318 --> 00:02:13,589
you will historic will figure depending

52
00:02:13,229 --> 00:02:16,109
on your

00:02:13,590 --> 00:02:19,769
position is Amanda called the Christ

54
00:02:16,110 --> 00:02:22,980
Jesus now I'm not<font color="#CCCCCC"> a religious man in the</font>

55
00:02:19,769 --> 00:02:25,640
traditional sense but I see the value in

56
00:02:22,979 --> 00:02:28,889
the stories<font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the myths and the</font>

57
00:02:25,639 --> 00:02:31,500
theology and the religion that we've

58
00:02:28,889 --> 00:02:34,199
<font color="#E5E5E5">been afforded and I look to it often for</font>

59
00:02:31,500 --> 00:02:36,330
advice and in a time when I'm feeling as

60
00:02:34,199 --> 00:02:40,018
if leadership is weighing heavily on me

61
00:02:36,330 --> 00:02:42,180
I look to the myth and<font color="#E5E5E5"> the man who our</font>

62
00:02:40,019 --> 00:02:46,200
current civilization has<font color="#CCCCCC"> been literally</font>

63
00:02:42,180 --> 00:02:49,340
an offspring of that of the things he

64
00:02:46,199 --> 00:02:51,929
shared Western civilization is a

65
00:02:49,340 --> 00:02:56,069
judeo-christian civilization and Jesus

66
00:02:51,930 --> 00:03:02,189
is at the pinnacle<font color="#CCCCCC"> of that myth now that</font>

67
00:02:56,068 --> 00:03:05,729
out the way even he who so many for so

68
00:03:02,189 --> 00:03:07,229
many generations millions and there I

69
00:03:05,729 --> 00:03:10,919
say billions of people have<font color="#E5E5E5"> been</font>

70
00:03:07,229 --> 00:03:15,389
affected by over the past two thousand

71
00:03:10,919 --> 00:03:21,029
years has even said take this shit away

72
00:03:15,389 --> 00:03:25,078
from me I believe it's luke 22 42 you're

73
00:03:21,030 --> 00:03:27,419
a scholar you'll probably correct me<font color="#CCCCCC"> but</font>

74
00:03:25,079 --> 00:03:30,090
<font color="#E5E5E5">Jesus goes on to say he says to his</font>

75
00:03:27,419 --> 00:03:34,138
father to the universe to God whatever

76
00:03:30,090 --> 00:03:38,609
<font color="#CCCCCC">is he like to call it take this cup away</font>

77
00:03:34,139 --> 00:03:40,349
from me take this away from me take this

78
00:03:38,609 --> 00:03:43,469
responsibility away from me take this

79
00:03:40,348 --> 00:03:45,750
burden away from me take everything that

80
00:03:43,469 --> 00:03:48,479
<font color="#E5E5E5">you've laid on my shoulders and I've so</font>

81
00:03:45,750 --> 00:03:52,560
firmly carried up until this point away

82
00:03:48,479 --> 00:03:54,988
from me the most pivotal figure in the

83
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:59,509
history of Western civilization has even

84
00:03:54,989 --> 00:04:04,620
said take this shit away from me thy cup

85
00:03:59,509 --> 00:04:06,328
remove it from my hands so to think<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

86
00:04:04,620 --> 00:04:08,819
you would feel weak in a position of

87
00:04:06,329 --> 00:04:13,340
<font color="#E5E5E5">power or in a position of leadership and</font>

88
00:04:08,818 --> 00:04:18,120
that that's unique it's completely wrong

89
00:04:13,340 --> 00:04:21,598
the fact is that not only has<font color="#E5E5E5"> Christ</font>

90
00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:23,990
afforded us the permission to feel weak

91
00:04:21,598 --> 00:04:25,529
in leadership but also gives us the

92
00:04:23,990 --> 00:04:27,629
answer

93
00:04:25,529 --> 00:04:30,138
to how to go about dealing<font color="#E5E5E5"> with that</font>

94
00:04:27,629 --> 00:04:35,000
because<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the very next line he says</font>

95
00:04:30,139 --> 00:04:39,000
but nevertheless let your will be done

96
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:42,000
within the very next line Jesus goes on

97
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:44,970
to say<font color="#CCCCCC"> although I hate this and I want</font>

98
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:47,329
<font color="#CCCCCC">you to take</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> away</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> from me I am yielding</font>

99
00:04:44,970 --> 00:04:50,820
to that which you are doing through me

100
00:04:47,329 --> 00:04:52,109
God the universe there<font color="#E5E5E5"> are so many</font>

101
00:04:50,819 --> 00:04:54,029
<font color="#E5E5E5">different ways</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to describe that an</font>

102
00:04:52,110 --> 00:04:56,460
animating energy that animating force in

103
00:04:54,029 --> 00:04:58,769
the world works through every<font color="#E5E5E5"> single one</font>

104
00:04:56,459 --> 00:05:01,680
of us whether we like it or not and we

105
00:04:58,769 --> 00:05:03,990
have two options we either resist or we

106
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:07,829
yield to it but it's moving forward if

107
00:05:03,990 --> 00:05:10,319
we resist we feel pain God is working

108
00:05:07,829 --> 00:05:12,329
through you and your<font color="#E5E5E5"> but you you don't</font>

109
00:05:10,319 --> 00:05:14,909
<font color="#E5E5E5">like it you're asking it for it to be</font>

110
00:05:12,329 --> 00:05:19,228
taken away God trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to move up through</font>

111
00:05:14,910 --> 00:05:21,870
you as if you are a flute that if

112
00:05:19,228 --> 00:05:23,879
allowed if the wind is allowed to blow

113
00:05:21,870 --> 00:05:26,970
smoothly through could play beautiful

114
00:05:23,879 --> 00:05:28,409
music but right<font color="#E5E5E5"> now you're putting your</font>

115
00:05:26,970 --> 00:05:31,530
hand on the end<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the flute so that no</font>

116
00:05:28,410 --> 00:05:33,600
music can go through ok so what<font color="#E5E5E5"> God is</font>

117
00:05:31,529 --> 00:05:36,959
indifferent if you can't handle this

118
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:40,680
shit he'll take his wind notice<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

119
00:05:36,959 --> 00:05:43,079
word wind air inspiration and give it

120
00:05:40,680 --> 00:05:44,819
somewhere<font color="#CCCCCC"> else because evolution is</font>

121
00:05:43,079 --> 00:05:47,129
going to happen God is going to do<font color="#E5E5E5"> what</font>

122
00:05:44,819 --> 00:05:50,930
God has to<font color="#E5E5E5"> do whether he can do it</font>

123
00:05:47,129 --> 00:05:56,969
through you or not now as a leader you

124
00:05:50,930 --> 00:05:59,280
because we<font color="#E5E5E5"> all are leaders how is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font>

125
00:05:56,970 --> 00:06:03,770
that you are either getting<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the way</font>

126
00:05:59,279 --> 00:06:07,079
of allowing leadership to happen or

127
00:06:03,769 --> 00:06:09,899
using to an allowing leadership to

128
00:06:07,079 --> 00:06:12,240
happen through you it's interesting

129
00:06:09,899 --> 00:06:14,038
because we have psychological mental

130
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:16,280
constructs ego constructs about way

131
00:06:14,038 --> 00:06:18,659
things wait the way things should look

132
00:06:16,279 --> 00:06:19,889
leadership looks a<font color="#E5E5E5"> particular way has on</font>

133
00:06:18,660 --> 00:06:21,689
a particular suit walks with a

134
00:06:19,889 --> 00:06:24,300
particular manner has a particular hair

135
00:06:21,689 --> 00:06:27,149
dress headdress big pointy hat or

136
00:06:24,300 --> 00:06:29,220
whatever but<font color="#CCCCCC"> that's not reality that</font>

137
00:06:27,149 --> 00:06:31,439
we've made<font color="#CCCCCC"> that shit up the way God</font>

138
00:06:29,220 --> 00:06:34,800
works is the way God freaking works and

139
00:06:31,439 --> 00:06:36,120
it always shows up weird that's why

140
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:37,860
Jesus was a weird motherfucker that<font color="#E5E5E5"> they</font>

141
00:06:36,120 --> 00:06:38,439
had<font color="#E5E5E5"> to kill well usually kill weird</font>

142
00:06:37,860 --> 00:06:42,250
dudes

143
00:06:38,439 --> 00:06:45,310
especially weird used with big mouths so

144
00:06:42,250 --> 00:06:47,170
part of the yielding is not holding so

145
00:06:45,310 --> 00:06:50,560
strong to what you think<font color="#CCCCCC"> it should</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> look</font>

146
00:06:47,170 --> 00:06:53,759
like but letting go and allowing the

147
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:55,930
magnificence to happen through you and

148
00:06:53,759 --> 00:06:58,120
appreciating what it ends up looking

149
00:06:55,930 --> 00:06:59,530
like I never<font color="#CCCCCC"> knew what the type of</font>

150
00:06:58,120 --> 00:07:02,889
leadership that I am providing for the

151
00:06:59,529 --> 00:07:04,389
world would look like in fact there was

152
00:07:02,889 --> 00:07:07,569
no YouTube when I decided to do what I

153
00:07:04,389 --> 00:07:09,099
wanted<font color="#CCCCCC"> to do I knew very early that I</font>

154
00:07:07,569 --> 00:07:11,589
wanted<font color="#E5E5E5"> to inspire others because I'm</font>

155
00:07:09,100 --> 00:07:13,480
pretty good at<font color="#E5E5E5"> it it's just kind of a</font>

156
00:07:11,589 --> 00:07:15,219
gift I know how to<font color="#E5E5E5"> talk to people to get</font>

157
00:07:13,480 --> 00:07:17,379
them<font color="#E5E5E5"> excited about the things that they</font>

158
00:07:15,220 --> 00:07:19,060
want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do in their lives about how they</font>

159
00:07:17,379 --> 00:07:23,589
can become a strongest version of

160
00:07:19,060 --> 00:07:27,009
themselves get them<font color="#E5E5E5"> to take action</font>

161
00:07:23,589 --> 00:07:32,279
towards that I am a leader but every day

162
00:07:27,009 --> 00:07:32,279
I like you may<font color="#E5E5E5"> be challenged with a</font>

163
00:07:33,209 --> 00:07:37,599
battle between the ego constructs and

164
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:40,509
that which God wants<font color="#CCCCCC"> to have happen and</font>

165
00:07:37,600 --> 00:07:42,490
God never repeats himself it's always

166
00:07:40,509 --> 00:07:47,409
<font color="#E5E5E5">going to be brand new and a lot of times</font>

167
00:07:42,490 --> 00:07:49,389
it looks like shit we don't like let go

168
00:07:47,410 --> 00:07:52,890
and allow leadership to happen through

169
00:07:49,389 --> 00:07:52,889
you everyone
