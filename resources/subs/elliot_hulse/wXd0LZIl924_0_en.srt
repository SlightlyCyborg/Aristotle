15
00:00:43,558 --> 00:00:47,820
what's actually going on there and I

16
00:00:45,420 --> 00:00:49,820
grew up with that stigma I guess you

17
00:00:47,820 --> 00:00:52,350
<font color="#E5E5E5">could say I'm like what are you kid</font>

18
00:00:49,820 --> 00:00:55,049
growing up in a neighborhood that's a

19
00:00:52,350 --> 00:00:58,350
long island which is they say is one of

20
00:00:55,049 --> 00:01:01,589
the most segregated suburbs in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the in</font>

21
00:00:58,350 --> 00:01:03,270
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> in the country and and Here I am</font>

22
00:01:01,590 --> 00:01:07,049
kind<font color="#CCCCCC"> of stuck somewhere in the middle</font>

23
00:01:03,270 --> 00:01:09,090
and from the age of five I'm being asked

24
00:01:07,049 --> 00:01:11,700
and I ultimately would ask myself what

25
00:01:09,090 --> 00:01:14,368
<font color="#CCCCCC">the hell Emma what am i what am I I've</font>

26
00:01:11,700 --> 00:01:15,810
got no like all types of strange ways<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

27
00:01:14,368 --> 00:01:17,938
figure out what you<font color="#CCCCCC"> are</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> when you're five</font>

28
00:01:15,810 --> 00:01:19,680
years old and one kid saying yeah look

29
00:01:17,938 --> 00:01:21,239
at your dick if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> look at your penis</font>

30
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:22,890
and it's brown then you're black if your

31
00:01:21,239 --> 00:01:26,219
<font color="#CCCCCC">penis is pink then you're worried and</font>

32
00:01:22,890 --> 00:01:30,030
I'm like I look at it I'm like I'd still

33
00:01:26,219 --> 00:01:34,650
somewhere in between so I could never

34
00:01:30,030 --> 00:01:36,659
really get an answer and and I guess you

35
00:01:34,650 --> 00:01:41,310
know try to keep this story as succinct

36
00:01:36,659 --> 00:01:43,439
as possible<font color="#E5E5E5"> I I at one point set out to</font>

37
00:01:41,310 --> 00:01:45,629
figure out what am I and I<font color="#E5E5E5"> came across a</font>

38
00:01:43,438 --> 00:01:48,118
book by a guy named Rallo may called

39
00:01:45,629 --> 00:01:50,489
man's search for himself and here i am

40
00:01:48,118 --> 00:01:54,450
in<font color="#CCCCCC"> sixth grade you know i'm like 12</font>

41
00:01:50,489 --> 00:01:56,368
years old reading philosophy by Admiral

42
00:01:54,450 --> 00:01:59,939
amazed when<font color="#E5E5E5"> I like the most most</font>

43
00:01:56,368 --> 00:02:02,640
influential philosophers you know for

44
00:01:59,938 --> 00:02:06,029
were authors on the topic<font color="#E5E5E5"> of philosophy</font>

45
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:07,710
and I'm 12 year old kid like Rita what

46
00:02:06,030 --> 00:02:08,818
man search for himself that's perfect

47
00:02:07,709 --> 00:02:10,560
cuz I<font color="#CCCCCC"> don't know what I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> am and I'm</font>

48
00:02:08,818 --> 00:02:12,509
trying to<font color="#E5E5E5"> figure myself out and that</font>

49
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:13,818
just led me on a lifelong journey of

50
00:02:12,509 --> 00:02:16,218
trying to figure<font color="#CCCCCC"> out</font>

51
00:02:13,818 --> 00:02:20,060
out who I am so when you<font color="#E5E5E5"> asked me about</font>

52
00:02:16,218 --> 00:02:22,280
<font color="#E5E5E5">these truths it's simply</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> because</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I've</font>

53
00:02:20,060 --> 00:02:24,468
also discovered along the path of trying

54
00:02:22,280 --> 00:02:25,818
to figure myself out that everyone else

55
00:02:24,468 --> 00:02:27,858
is trying to<font color="#E5E5E5"> figure themselves out too</font>

56
00:02:25,818 --> 00:02:29,688
so when I start saying these things on

57
00:02:27,859 --> 00:02:31,609
camera it resonates with people because

58
00:02:29,688 --> 00:02:33,919
they're like oh yeah you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> I have the</font>

59
00:02:31,609 --> 00:02:36,109
same<font color="#E5E5E5"> problem although</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> on the surface I</font>

60
00:02:33,919 --> 00:02:37,548
look<font color="#E5E5E5"> like I know what I am deep down</font>

61
00:02:36,109 --> 00:02:39,139
most of us are struggling with<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

62
00:02:37,549 --> 00:02:41,510
question what am i what am I here for

63
00:02:39,139 --> 00:02:43,700
what am I supposed to do and there's so

64
00:02:41,509 --> 00:02:47,328
much confusion I think what I offer is

65
00:02:43,699 --> 00:02:49,339
kind of permission to explore that sure

66
00:02:47,329 --> 00:02:51,739
that seems like<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's something that's</font>

67
00:02:49,340 --> 00:02:53,150
going on a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> more now than ever before</font>

68
00:02:51,739 --> 00:02:55,400
I guess what the internet and stuff like

69
00:02:53,150 --> 00:02:58,069
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> but now it's like we're getting all</font>

70
00:02:55,400 --> 00:02:59,510
these permission slips to be able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be</font>

71
00:02:58,068 --> 00:03:01,698
more of<font color="#CCCCCC"> ourselves like we have a guy</font>

72
00:02:59,509 --> 00:03:03,679
named elliott hulse up here who is a

73
00:03:01,699 --> 00:03:05,299
strength guy and he does a lot of you

74
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:06,590
<font color="#CCCCCC">know strong man shit and he stands up</font>

75
00:03:05,299 --> 00:03:08,870
there and talks but then we have another

76
00:03:06,590 --> 00:03:10,158
guy who's a tech guy who's up here

77
00:03:08,870 --> 00:03:13,129
talking then we have another guy who's

78
00:03:10,158 --> 00:03:15,048
talking about you know psychedelics and

79
00:03:13,128 --> 00:03:16,759
all these<font color="#CCCCCC"> things and they're</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> all doing</font>

80
00:03:15,049 --> 00:03:18,560
basically the same thing is giving us

81
00:03:16,759 --> 00:03:21,228
permission to be more<font color="#E5E5E5"> of ourselves I</font>

82
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:24,340
think<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's that's huge right now do</font>

83
00:03:21,229 --> 00:03:27,259
<font color="#E5E5E5">you see that being something is that is</font>

84
00:03:24,340 --> 00:03:31,459
kind of<font color="#E5E5E5"> a turning point maybe right now</font>

85
00:03:27,258 --> 00:03:33,469
you know this whole Maya calendar thing

86
00:03:31,459 --> 00:03:35,750
that was supposed to happen like a world

87
00:03:33,469 --> 00:03:37,489
is supposed to end you know this year

88
00:03:35,750 --> 00:03:39,079
with the Mayan calendar I think a<font color="#CCCCCC"> lot of</font>

89
00:03:37,489 --> 00:03:41,688
people went about it the wrong way and I

90
00:03:39,079 --> 00:03:45,019
am by no means of scholar on the subject

91
00:03:41,688 --> 00:03:48,709
but<font color="#E5E5E5"> you don't have</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to be a you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> don't</font>

92
00:03:45,019 --> 00:03:51,469
have to be a scientist to realize<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

93
00:03:48,709 --> 00:03:53,688
we're at a huge global conscious

94
00:03:51,469 --> 00:03:55,098
awakening and it's because<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the</font>

95
00:03:53,688 --> 00:03:58,188
<font color="#CCCCCC">fucking Internet I mean there's no two</font>

96
00:03:55,098 --> 00:03:59,358
ways about it I have conversations you

97
00:03:58,188 --> 00:04:01,728
know everyone's<font color="#CCCCCC"> Allah engage in like</font>

98
00:03:59,359 --> 00:04:03,949
comment conversations with people on

99
00:04:01,729 --> 00:04:06,669
facebook and like they're citing all

100
00:04:03,949 --> 00:04:09,229
types of incredible ideas and books and

101
00:04:06,669 --> 00:04:10,789
referencing different articles and

102
00:04:09,229 --> 00:04:12,079
videos and I'm like this<font color="#CCCCCC"> person's</font>

103
00:04:10,788 --> 00:04:13,638
putting<font color="#E5E5E5"> together a great case for</font>

104
00:04:12,079 --> 00:04:15,799
whatever it<font color="#CCCCCC"> is that they're</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> trying to</font>

105
00:04:13,639 --> 00:04:17,689
<font color="#E5E5E5">either convince themselves or convince</font>

106
00:04:15,799 --> 00:04:19,689
others of and then I go and I'll click

107
00:04:17,689 --> 00:04:23,810
on their profile it's like the kids 12

108
00:04:19,689 --> 00:04:24,769
I'm like wow this is crazy you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know</font>

109
00:04:23,810 --> 00:04:27,680
there's a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of there's a lot of</font>

110
00:04:24,769 --> 00:04:29,750
benefit to it but there's also<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think</font>

111
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:31,759
other thing that I end up<font color="#CCCCCC"> doing that is</font>

112
00:04:29,750 --> 00:04:35,360
that's helpful for this whole stage of

113
00:04:31,759 --> 00:04:39,100
our our our development as<font color="#E5E5E5"> a race of</font>

114
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:42,770
human beings is that although we<font color="#CCCCCC"> are</font>

115
00:04:39,100 --> 00:04:44,479
expanding in the abstract we're learning

116
00:04:42,769 --> 00:04:46,069
a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> more to have a conversation with a</font>

117
00:04:44,478 --> 00:04:47,538
12 year old kid that that is is

118
00:04:46,069 --> 00:04:52,189
referencing all the things<font color="#E5E5E5"> that they</font>

119
00:04:47,538 --> 00:04:53,779
reference is incredible but then we also

120
00:04:52,189 --> 00:04:55,399
end up living<font color="#E5E5E5"> in an abstract world</font>

121
00:04:53,779 --> 00:04:56,478
because all of everything we do is hear

122
00:04:55,399 --> 00:04:59,089
everything we do is<font color="#CCCCCC"> in the clouds</font>

123
00:04:56,478 --> 00:05:01,430
everything<font color="#E5E5E5"> that we do is through did the</font>

124
00:04:59,089 --> 00:05:04,129
digital technology and very few people

125
00:05:01,430 --> 00:05:06,709
embody any of it so we're losing a lot

126
00:05:04,129 --> 00:05:11,089
<font color="#CCCCCC">of our bodily expression our bodily</font>

127
00:05:06,709 --> 00:05:13,219
knowledge our physical wisdom in order

128
00:05:11,089 --> 00:05:15,819
to continue expanding our consciousness

129
00:05:13,220 --> 00:05:18,440
reading thinking<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know observing</font>

130
00:05:15,819 --> 00:05:20,629
taking in<font color="#CCCCCC"> and but</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> not really digesting</font>

131
00:05:18,439 --> 00:05:22,009
so it's it's it's kind of it's an

132
00:05:20,629 --> 00:05:23,870
interesting time that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> the time where</font>

133
00:05:22,009 --> 00:05:25,939
sometimes right diggings there's there's

134
00:05:23,870 --> 00:05:27,680
a point<font color="#E5E5E5"> to where knowledge becomes or</font>

135
00:05:25,939 --> 00:05:29,930
can become detrimental once you

136
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:32,740
accumulate so much and<font color="#E5E5E5"> then you have to</font>

137
00:05:29,930 --> 00:05:36,259
actually start applying some of it<font color="#CCCCCC"> right</font>

138
00:05:32,740 --> 00:05:37,490
yes<font color="#E5E5E5"> I made a video this week and it's</font>

139
00:05:36,259 --> 00:05:40,158
<font color="#E5E5E5">probably the second time i made this</font>

00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:51,348
gadgets stop reading<font color="#E5E5E5"> books stop asking</font>

that's called experience experience

leads to wisdom you got to fucking do

160
00:06:25,908 --> 00:06:29,478
something and that's a big<font color="#E5E5E5"> part</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of our</font>

162
00:06:29,478 --> 00:06:34,399
much and talking so much that we don't

166
00:06:37,180 --> 00:06:41,060
basically in our heads or in the clouds

167
00:06:40,189 --> 00:06:43,310
and whenever

168
00:06:41,060 --> 00:06:45,889
<font color="#E5E5E5">it's in our heads a lot of times that</font>

169
00:06:43,310 --> 00:06:47,240
leads to this duel dualism you know so

170
00:06:45,889 --> 00:06:49,430
<font color="#CCCCCC">just like you said every for every</font>

going to be someone<font color="#E5E5E5"> that says now that</font>

00:06:50,389 --> 00:06:54,889
exercise sucks or or for every diet that

174
00:06:53,480 --> 00:06:58,669
we choose oh there's another<font color="#E5E5E5"> one that's</font>

184
00:07:21,019 --> 00:07:28,279
agree<font color="#CCCCCC"> with that we we've come to a place</font>

185
00:07:25,300 --> 00:07:30,740
where we've conceptualized that the

186
00:07:28,279 --> 00:07:33,859
brain or the mind which is a better way

187
00:07:30,740 --> 00:07:35,870
<font color="#CCCCCC">to describe it stops at our neck so it's</font>

188
00:07:33,860 --> 00:07:37,819
like<font color="#E5E5E5"> we've got the the cortex and</font>

189
00:07:35,870 --> 00:07:39,680
neocortex and that's basically it so if

190
00:07:37,819 --> 00:07:42,259
you're<font color="#CCCCCC"> thinking</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it's all happening here</font>

doesn't take again it doesn't take a

193
00:07:43,370 --> 00:07:46,970
scientist to look at a picture of the

194

second your brain<font color="#CCCCCC"> doesn't stop there</font>

196
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:54,560

down<font color="#E5E5E5"> into your pelvic floor which</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

just<font color="#E5E5E5"> adds or perhaps more powerful</font>

218
00:08:39,889 --> 00:08:43,399
you is the ego and we've become very

219
00:08:41,479 --> 00:08:46,778
<font color="#E5E5E5">attached to the ego we don't realize</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">that there's an entire magnificent</font>

energy<font color="#E5E5E5"> the about this magnificent mind</font>

222
00:08:50,659 --> 00:08:54,250
that's doing fifty percent or perhaps

223
00:08:53,299 --> 00:08:57,429
more

224
00:08:54,250 --> 00:08:59,679
the work for<font color="#CCCCCC"> us</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> but yet we we ignore it</font>

225
00:08:57,429 --> 00:09:02,229
as if it's not as intelligent as this

226
00:08:59,679 --> 00:09:03,549
brain nobody who grew that baby in your

227

belly who's growing you right now<font color="#CCCCCC"> are</font>

you growing your bones right now you

just worked out right<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay cool see you</font>

230
00:09:06,399 --> 00:09:09,399
wait and you did some bench press who's

231
00:09:07,870 --> 00:09:11,710
growing your muscle you didn't grow your

232

muscle you just beat up<font color="#E5E5E5"> your muscle see</font>

233
00:09:11,710 --> 00:09:17,320
who's doing all that there is<font color="#E5E5E5"> another</font>

234
00:09:14,919 --> 00:09:19,059
mind and I say other mind just because

235
00:09:17,320 --> 00:09:20,800
<font color="#E5E5E5">of what you described as this dichotomy</font>

236
00:09:19,059 --> 00:09:25,149
which is truly not a dichotomy it's a

237
00:09:20,799 --> 00:09:27,370
unity that we are our bodies so why have

238
00:09:25,149 --> 00:09:28,870
we and I know why<font color="#E5E5E5"> we have culture and</font>

239
00:09:27,370 --> 00:09:32,519
done this to us religion has done this

240
00:09:28,870 --> 00:09:36,039
to<font color="#CCCCCC"> us but we're at a place</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> where</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we</font>

241
00:09:32,519 --> 00:09:37,569
ignore and almost hate that which comes

242
00:09:36,039 --> 00:09:39,549
up in our body<font color="#E5E5E5"> and when they speak of</font>

243
00:09:37,570 --> 00:09:42,370
when the agents talk about following

244
00:09:39,549 --> 00:09:44,889
your heart which<font color="#CCCCCC"> is also cinema</font>

245
00:09:42,370 --> 00:09:47,379
synonymous with I see you've got<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

and you have ever<font color="#E5E5E5"> done this what you're</font>

250
00:09:54,190 --> 00:09:57,070
basically saying is<font color="#E5E5E5"> that there's a unity</font>

251
00:09:55,840 --> 00:09:59,889
there's a Trinity between the mind

252
00:09:57,070 --> 00:10:02,620
father it's the father mind up here that

253
00:09:59,889 --> 00:10:05,710
we<font color="#CCCCCC"> become so we worship but we've come</font>

254
00:10:02,620 --> 00:10:07,810
to worship out of balance to the Sun the

255
00:10:05,710 --> 00:10:09,910
Sun is more like Jesus the lover the

256
00:10:07,809 --> 00:10:11,799
feeler<font color="#E5E5E5"> Jesus was a feeler he was a lover</font>

257
00:10:09,909 --> 00:10:13,149
he came in<font color="#CCCCCC"> and basically used his</font>

258
00:10:11,799 --> 00:10:16,689
passion they say The Passion of Christ

259
00:10:13,149 --> 00:10:19,899
to to invite us<font color="#E5E5E5"> to follow our hearts and</font>

260
00:10:16,690 --> 00:10:23,320
then there's this the vertical plane the

261
00:10:19,899 --> 00:10:26,639
plane through which animals behave the

262
00:10:23,320 --> 00:10:29,140
way we call the Holy Ghost the instinct

263
00:10:26,639 --> 00:10:31,149
how is<font color="#CCCCCC"> it that we're so up in here with</font>

264
00:10:29,139 --> 00:10:32,500
<font color="#CCCCCC">the father that we forgotten the Sun</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

265
00:10:31,149 --> 00:10:34,629
call yourself a Christian but it's like

266
00:10:32,500 --> 00:10:36,940
you don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> listen to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> your</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> heart and the</font>

267
00:10:34,629 --> 00:10:38,919
Holy Ghost which is what ties the whole

268
00:10:36,940 --> 00:10:40,660
thing together give it whatever name you

269
00:10:38,919 --> 00:10:44,379
want because if you studied science

270
00:10:40,659 --> 00:10:47,289
they'll call it the the neocortex the

271
00:10:44,379 --> 00:10:49,080
cortex<font color="#E5E5E5"> the medulla it's a Trinity it's</font>

00:10:59,830 --> 00:11:04,750
chosen one piece of it<font color="#E5E5E5"> and if ignored</font>

00:11:01,990 --> 00:11:07,778
the Son and the Holy Ghost or the cortex

a the mammalian and the reptilian part

281
00:11:09,909 --> 00:11:14,708
of our consciousness we can't have one

282
00:11:12,519 --> 00:11:16,480
without the other that's what's crazy to

<font color="#CCCCCC">these philosophies and religions and</font>

285
00:11:18,669 --> 00:11:25,448
science and things like that they are

286
00:11:20,769 --> 00:11:26,558
all saying the same exact thing and I

287
00:11:25,448 --> 00:11:28,628
mean it<font color="#E5E5E5"> seems like even going further</font>

288
00:11:26,558 --> 00:11:31,088
than that like<font color="#E5E5E5"> once you start</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to dive</font>

289
00:11:28,629 --> 00:11:32,350

that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you kind of look to that kind of</font>

guide you in a direction or that kind of

292
00:11:33,698 --> 00:11:38,528
give you permission to accept the ideas

293
00:11:36,519 --> 00:11:40,058
that you<font color="#CCCCCC"> have all of those people</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> are</font>

294
00:11:38,528 --> 00:11:42,519
saying the same thing<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Paul</font>

297
00:11:45,549 --> 00:11:49,688
all these different people are saying

298
00:11:46,889 --> 00:11:52,318
very very similar<font color="#E5E5E5"> thing just from their</font>

299
00:11:49,688 --> 00:11:55,838
own from their own unique perspective

300
00:11:52,318 --> 00:11:58,870
it's it's funny because the limiting

301
00:11:55,839 --> 00:12:02,139
factor in all of<font color="#E5E5E5"> this are the symbols</font>

302
00:11:58,870 --> 00:12:05,078
that we're using to describe it it's all

303
00:12:02,139 --> 00:12:07,539
one thing except you can your symbol

304
00:12:05,078 --> 00:12:10,628
might be quarks and bosons and electrons

305
00:12:07,539 --> 00:12:12,909
and his is animals<font color="#E5E5E5"> and burning bushes</font>

306
00:12:10,629 --> 00:12:14,319
but the fact<font color="#E5E5E5"> is they're all trying to</font>

307
00:12:12,909 --> 00:12:16,919
point to<font color="#CCCCCC"> the same</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> thing so it doesn't</font>

308
00:12:14,318 --> 00:12:18,729
<font color="#CCCCCC">matter what words you use to describe</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font>

309
00:12:16,919 --> 00:12:20,620
and the problem is<font color="#CCCCCC"> that there are all</font>

310
00:12:18,730 --> 00:12:24,188
types of associations with the words you

311
00:12:20,620 --> 00:12:25,539
choose to to adopt you see which is

312
00:12:24,188 --> 00:12:30,969
where we get screwed<font color="#E5E5E5"> up this is where we</font>

313
00:12:25,539 --> 00:12:33,610
become idlers of false prophets because

314
00:12:30,970 --> 00:12:36,160
these false idols are our things words

315
00:12:33,610 --> 00:12:38,350
are things ideas<font color="#E5E5E5"> or things and we hold</font>

316
00:12:36,159 --> 00:12:40,719
on to well Jesus Christ is my<font color="#E5E5E5"> thing and</font>

317
00:12:38,350 --> 00:12:42,339
that's it so I don't want to hear or

318
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:44,319
believe or talk about<font color="#E5E5E5"> or consider</font>

319
00:12:42,339 --> 00:12:47,079
anything else that might actually make

320
00:12:44,318 --> 00:12:48,519
<font color="#E5E5E5">sense and then the same</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> thing on the</font>

321
00:12:47,078 --> 00:12:51,308
other end of the spectrum it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> like well</font>

322
00:12:48,519 --> 00:12:52,808
my idea is that science is that's it<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

323
00:12:51,308 --> 00:12:53,980
that's all but then you also have<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

324
00:12:52,808 --> 00:12:56,708
consider well you know there<font color="#E5E5E5"> are parts</font>

325
00:12:53,980 --> 00:12:58,089
of science<font color="#CCCCCC"> that we just</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we might think</font>

326
00:12:56,708 --> 00:12:59,409
that we'll figure out or<font color="#CCCCCC"> that we have</font>

327
00:12:58,089 --> 00:13:00,639
figured<font color="#E5E5E5"> out already but really what it</font>

328
00:12:59,409 --> 00:13:01,870
boils down to<font color="#CCCCCC"> it you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> look at like</font>

329
00:13:00,639 --> 00:13:05,528
quantum mechanics which a lot of people

330
00:13:01,870 --> 00:13:09,999
say is this quackery it's because<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

331
00:13:05,528 --> 00:13:12,299
final<font color="#CCCCCC"> answer is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I don't know I think the</font>

332
00:13:09,999 --> 00:13:14,949
<font color="#E5E5E5">best place to be in all of this is I</font>

333
00:13:12,299 --> 00:13:16,928
don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> know let's talk about it let's</font>

334
00:13:14,948 --> 00:13:21,370
enjoy the conversation that's what

335
00:13:16,928 --> 00:13:23,019
gnosis is gnosis and<font color="#CCCCCC"> Gnosticism is let's</font>

336
00:13:21,370 --> 00:13:26,350
talk about<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> shit because it's pretty</font>

337
00:13:23,019 --> 00:13:27,639
fascinating but let's not hold on<font color="#E5E5E5"> to it</font>

338
00:13:26,350 --> 00:13:29,589
<font color="#E5E5E5">and become personally identified with</font>

339
00:13:27,639 --> 00:13:32,919
any of it because really<font color="#CCCCCC"> the minute your</font>

340
00:13:29,589 --> 00:13:36,130
grasp it you lost it living within<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

341
00:13:32,919 --> 00:13:37,870
mystery huh embrace it ah embracing it's

342
00:13:36,129 --> 00:13:39,610
so much fun it's and it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> so much more</font>

343
00:13:37,870 --> 00:13:40,778
fun to write that's way I see it it's

344
00:13:39,610 --> 00:13:42,850
<font color="#E5E5E5">like I don't want to be right and I</font>

345
00:13:40,778 --> 00:13:44,679
<font color="#CCCCCC">don't want the truth I'd rather dance</font>

346
00:13:42,850 --> 00:13:46,899
because you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> what when do you enjoy</font>

347
00:13:44,679 --> 00:13:49,719
the dance while you're fucking grinding

348
00:13:46,899 --> 00:13:52,120
not when a song has ended why are<font color="#E5E5E5"> we so</font>

349
00:13:49,720 --> 00:13:54,610
so attached to getting to the end of the

350
00:13:52,120 --> 00:13:57,909
song here it<font color="#E5E5E5"> is I don't I just want to</font>

351
00:13:54,610 --> 00:14:01,690
<font color="#E5E5E5">keep dancing the Alan Alan Watts murders</font>

352
00:13:57,909 --> 00:14:04,480
that says he's great do you ever listen

353
00:14:01,690 --> 00:14:06,760
to any uh any old<font color="#CCCCCC"> Terence Mckenna so</font>

354
00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:09,278
that he may have<font color="#E5E5E5"> a book of his that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

355
00:14:06,759 --> 00:14:11,830
<font color="#E5E5E5">haven't read yet he makes such a good</font>

356
00:14:09,278 --> 00:14:13,778
this this type of guy<font color="#E5E5E5"> he's really good</font>

357
00:14:11,830 --> 00:14:15,400
with words and he'll say words<font color="#E5E5E5"> that are</font>

358
00:14:13,778 --> 00:14:17,500
just so off the beaten path<font color="#E5E5E5"> that you</font>

359
00:14:15,399 --> 00:14:20,189
never heard<font color="#E5E5E5"> of any has it's real funny</font>

360
00:14:17,500 --> 00:14:23,470
voice he kind of talks like this but uh

361
00:14:20,190 --> 00:14:27,130
he<font color="#CCCCCC"> he just kills these ideas man like</font>

362
00:14:23,470 --> 00:14:30,009
he'll take this idea<font color="#CCCCCC"> of language and he</font>

363
00:14:27,129 --> 00:14:32,588
says language and he goes off on it for

364
00:14:30,009 --> 00:14:34,689
a long time<font color="#E5E5E5"> how languages is so limiting</font>

365
00:14:32,589 --> 00:14:37,930
to us and that the words<font color="#E5E5E5"> that we use</font>

366
00:14:34,690 --> 00:14:40,180
your word for you know let's just<font color="#E5E5E5"> say</font>

367
00:14:37,929 --> 00:14:42,458
loves is a popular your your word for

368
00:14:40,179 --> 00:14:44,409
love and the meaning for you is<font color="#CCCCCC"> totally</font>

369
00:14:42,458 --> 00:14:46,389
different<font color="#E5E5E5"> right now than it is for me</font>

370
00:14:44,409 --> 00:14:49,838
and then it's totally different for you

371
00:14:46,389 --> 00:14:53,139
as every moment goes by and the

372
00:14:49,839 --> 00:14:54,520
conditions around us change the word

373
00:14:53,139 --> 00:14:56,708
becomes different all the time but we

374
00:14:54,519 --> 00:15:00,850
say I love you or we say let's let's

375
00:14:56,708 --> 00:15:02,169
let's have love instead of war but we

376
00:15:00,850 --> 00:15:03,580
don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> even really know what that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> means</font>

377
00:15:02,169 --> 00:15:06,699
like and it's always means something

378
00:15:03,580 --> 00:15:08,950
different and you can't prove<font color="#CCCCCC"> it right</font>

379
00:15:06,700 --> 00:15:11,470
prove love so you tell you a woman<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

380
00:15:08,950 --> 00:15:12,490
you love her and she says prove it how

381
00:15:11,470 --> 00:15:14,379
the fuck were you gonna buy her

382
00:15:12,490 --> 00:15:15,580
something we're gonna say i love you how

383
00:15:14,379 --> 00:15:17,559
many<font color="#E5E5E5"> times you say you love me you</font>

384
00:15:15,580 --> 00:15:19,150
cannot prove love and<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's kind of</font>

385
00:15:17,559 --> 00:15:20,859
like you know why does the science hop

386
00:15:19,149 --> 00:15:22,419
on that one and the same way that like

387
00:15:20,860 --> 00:15:24,039
we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> trying to prove god it's like okay</font>

388
00:15:22,419 --> 00:15:25,990
well you know once you<font color="#E5E5E5"> prove love while</font>

389
00:15:24,039 --> 00:15:27,879
you're at it it's just what this is one

390
00:15:25,990 --> 00:15:30,070
of those things it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> like you're</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> not you</font>

391
00:15:27,879 --> 00:15:31,689
can't because it's experiential it's

392
00:15:30,070 --> 00:15:33,579
there is so dynamic there's so many

393
00:15:31,690 --> 00:15:35,050
<font color="#E5E5E5">different pieces to it I don't</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> think at</font>

394
00:15:33,578 --> 00:15:37,359
our level of consciousness we

395
00:15:35,049 --> 00:15:40,539
we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to figure it out</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> but let's</font>

396
00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:42,639
dance with it a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of a lot of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> two</font>

397
00:15:40,539 --> 00:15:45,189
right now<font color="#E5E5E5"> people are trying to disprove</font>

398
00:15:42,639 --> 00:15:46,659
all of this stuff as opposed to just let

399
00:15:45,190 --> 00:15:49,269
it be like nuts that's that that<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of</font>

400
00:15:46,659 --> 00:15:51,549
leads to a conundrum here is like we're

401
00:15:49,269 --> 00:15:53,409
<font color="#E5E5E5">trying to disprove all this stuff and if</font>

402
00:15:51,549 --> 00:15:55,509
<font color="#E5E5E5">we kind of get close well then what do</font>

403
00:15:53,409 --> 00:15:58,120
<font color="#E5E5E5">we have left to live for you know what I</font>

404
00:15:55,509 --> 00:15:59,919
really like what the the hero's journey

405
00:15:58,120 --> 00:16:02,049
you know I heard<font color="#E5E5E5"> you talked</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> about this</font>

406
00:15:59,919 --> 00:16:03,939
before but man that hero's journey the

407
00:16:02,049 --> 00:16:06,250
Joseph Campbell talks about<font color="#E5E5E5"> and not not</font>

408
00:16:03,940 --> 00:16:09,579
only<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> but every every myth that has</font>

409
00:16:06,250 --> 00:16:11,289
ever you know been around talks about

410
00:16:09,578 --> 00:16:14,969
this journey that we go on and the

411
00:16:11,289 --> 00:16:18,129
journey is the myth itself like<font color="#E5E5E5"> mmm</font>

412
00:16:14,970 --> 00:16:20,620
that's it the journey is the myth itself

413
00:16:18,129 --> 00:16:23,889
that's so beautiful hey<font color="#E5E5E5"> Joseph Campbell</font>

414
00:16:20,620 --> 00:16:28,209
brings it all together for<font color="#CCCCCC"> us so how</font>

415
00:16:23,889 --> 00:16:30,220
have you do you think that when we go

416
00:16:28,208 --> 00:16:34,958
through<font color="#CCCCCC"> a lifetime we experience this</font>

417
00:16:30,220 --> 00:16:38,740
myth add the hero's journey as a whole

418
00:16:34,958 --> 00:16:41,409
does it seem like a cycle to you we keep

419
00:16:38,740 --> 00:16:44,528
we keep doing<font color="#E5E5E5"> this hero's journey is it</font>

420
00:16:41,409 --> 00:16:47,469
a daily hero's journey is it a lifetime

421

422
00:16:47,470 --> 00:16:53,070
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Sun and those type of things</font>

423
00:16:49,708 --> 00:16:56,139
it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of an abstract question but</font>

424
00:16:53,070 --> 00:16:59,980
well I'll give<font color="#E5E5E5"> you an abstract answer in</font>

425
00:16:56,139 --> 00:17:03,069
the same<font color="#CCCCCC"> way that there are days in a</font>

426
00:16:59,980 --> 00:17:06,039
year and years in a century<font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

427
00:17:03,070 --> 00:17:08,259
centuries in eons is the same way that

428
00:17:06,039 --> 00:17:09,699
there are journeys I mean you're going

429
00:17:08,259 --> 00:17:13,088
<font color="#E5E5E5">on a hero's journey in the minute you</font>

430
00:17:09,699 --> 00:17:15,130
wake up<font color="#E5E5E5"> every day and every time a woman</font>

431
00:17:13,088 --> 00:17:17,980
<font color="#E5E5E5">goes through her monthly cycle and every</font>

432
00:17:15,130 --> 00:17:20,079
time the the nature changes we're

433
00:17:17,980 --> 00:17:22,328
constantly evolving and I think there

434
00:17:20,078 --> 00:17:24,609
are stages like<font color="#CCCCCC"> you know he describes</font>

435
00:17:22,328 --> 00:17:26,918
just camel describes that we're going to

436
00:17:24,609 --> 00:17:30,668
see recurring over and over again you

437
00:17:26,919 --> 00:17:34,000
see so to say that there's a final point

438
00:17:30,669 --> 00:17:36,130
is like saying that<font color="#E5E5E5"> when today and we're</font>

439
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:37,839
<font color="#CCCCCC">all done you know it's just an</font>

440
00:17:36,130 --> 00:17:39,760
<font color="#E5E5E5">ever-evolving thing it's like that it's</font>

441
00:17:37,839 --> 00:17:42,189
like that Trinity symbol it's like we

442
00:17:39,759 --> 00:17:44,799
just keep doing<font color="#CCCCCC"> this and it keeps going</font>

443
00:17:42,190 --> 00:17:48,920
<font color="#E5E5E5">around and around and I think sometimes</font>

444
00:17:44,799 --> 00:17:51,649
we're looking for we're looking for<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

445
00:17:48,920 --> 00:17:54,320
a purpose or we're looking for a meaning

446
00:17:51,650 --> 00:17:56,390
as if it's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to go bang at some</font>

447
00:17:54,319 --> 00:17:59,210
point but it never does so the only

448
00:17:56,390 --> 00:18:00,980
purpose and meaning is<font color="#CCCCCC"> that which we we</font>

449
00:17:59,210 --> 00:18:03,019
adopt while we're<font color="#CCCCCC"> playing this game</font>

450
00:18:00,980 --> 00:18:04,339
while we're doing the dance we kind of

451
00:18:03,019 --> 00:18:07,730
choose so we're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> mom bar</font>

452
00:18:04,339 --> 00:18:09,679
we're gonna do some slow dancing but<font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

453
00:18:07,730 --> 00:18:11,269
that becomes your journey that becomes

454
00:18:09,680 --> 00:18:12,440
your purpose that becomes your mission

455
00:18:11,269 --> 00:18:17,930
it's like what kind of dance are<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

457
00:18:17,930 --> 00:18:25,490
something that<font color="#CCCCCC"> relates to this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I heard</font>

458
00:18:21,230 --> 00:18:28,730
was this feeling that you<font color="#E5E5E5"> get in your</font>

00:18:25,490 --> 00:18:31,490
heart you know that tells you what dance

461
00:18:31,490 --> 00:18:35,509
you in that<font color="#E5E5E5"> direction that says this is</font>

469
00:18:49,279 --> 00:18:54,139
listen to that that feeling that<font color="#CCCCCC"> you're</font>

470
00:18:52,369 --> 00:18:56,719
basically disobeying like that is God

471
00:18:54,140 --> 00:18:58,910
running through you're disobeying that I

472

thought that was<font color="#CCCCCC"> just fantastic it was</font>

480
00:19:17,869 --> 00:19:21,619

your heart you shouldn't follow your

483
00:19:22,579 --> 00:19:26,599
heart because your heart will lead you

498
00:20:00,140 --> 00:20:02,809
you're saying you'll eat you're cutting

499
00:20:01,819 --> 00:20:04,249
out a big part

500
00:20:02,808 --> 00:20:07,069
of what a human a human being is a

501
00:20:04,249 --> 00:20:09,139
triune being it's Paul MacLean even<font color="#CCCCCC"> as a</font>

502
00:20:07,069 --> 00:20:11,450
book that's that's that describes this

503
00:20:09,138 --> 00:20:15,258
in a very<font color="#E5E5E5"> scientific way but there's a</font>

504
00:20:11,450 --> 00:20:17,419
try you in mind why separate one from

505
00:20:15,259 --> 00:20:20,058
the other it is the most inhumane thing

506
00:20:17,419 --> 00:20:22,370
that you<font color="#E5E5E5"> could possibly do the problem</font>

507
00:20:20,058 --> 00:20:24,859
is we become attached to what we've been

508
00:20:22,369 --> 00:20:27,439
conditioned<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> believe the father the</font>

509
00:20:24,859 --> 00:20:28,878
head is a very<font color="#CCCCCC"> easy thing to manipulate</font>

510
00:20:27,440 --> 00:20:30,139
someone by you can't manipulate someone

511
00:20:28,878 --> 00:20:32,658
who's in their passion was in their

512

heart try to manipulate<font color="#E5E5E5"> three-year-old</font>

513
00:20:32,659 --> 00:20:38,990
kid who wants ice cream he's all here

514
00:20:36,288 --> 00:20:41,240
he's all in his balls<font color="#E5E5E5"> and heart it's not</font>

515
00:20:38,990 --> 00:20:43,220
going to be an<font color="#E5E5E5"> easy fight but by the</font>

516
00:20:41,240 --> 00:20:44,149
time he becomes 13 and you're like oh

517
00:20:43,220 --> 00:20:45,798
you can't have ice cream<font color="#E5E5E5"> because he</font>

518
00:20:44,148 --> 00:20:47,778
doesn't know dinner's not done he's like

519
00:20:45,798 --> 00:20:49,788
I right cool because you already he's

520
00:20:47,778 --> 00:20:54,169
<font color="#E5E5E5">already done cut him off on the rest of</font>

521
00:20:49,788 --> 00:20:55,730
his body so in the same way and I'm

522
00:20:54,169 --> 00:20:58,100
<font color="#E5E5E5">starting to ramp in the same way that it</font>

523
00:20:55,730 --> 00:20:59,990
that in many instances a three-year-old

524
00:20:58,099 --> 00:21:01,339
or a baby will<font color="#E5E5E5"> not even fear because</font>

525
00:20:59,990 --> 00:21:04,788
we're trying to condition them at that

526
00:21:01,339 --> 00:21:08,148
age but a baby a newborn is hungry for

527
00:21:04,788 --> 00:21:10,999
milk guess what it's going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to get what</font>

528
00:21:08,148 --> 00:21:14,748
it needs if nature follows its course

529
00:21:10,999 --> 00:21:17,149
that baby will be satisfied I don't

530
00:21:14,749 --> 00:21:19,538
think<font color="#CCCCCC"> that ends when we grow up the only</font>

531
00:21:17,148 --> 00:21:22,278
difference is that the hand of our

532
00:21:19,538 --> 00:21:24,859
earthly father instead of putting the

533
00:21:22,278 --> 00:21:27,440
bottle in our<font color="#CCCCCC"> mouth the hand of our</font>

534
00:21:24,859 --> 00:21:30,229
Heavenly<font color="#E5E5E5"> Father or the universe will</font>

535
00:21:27,440 --> 00:21:33,230
always take care of<font color="#E5E5E5"> us if we speak our</font>

536
00:21:30,230 --> 00:21:35,389
hearts the same way the baby screams and

537
00:21:33,230 --> 00:21:37,278
there's a bottle in his mouth<font color="#E5E5E5"> I open my</font>

538
00:21:35,388 --> 00:21:38,839
big fucking mouth and say this is what I

539
00:21:37,278 --> 00:21:40,249
want this is what I'm going to do it I'm

540
00:21:38,839 --> 00:21:42,699
not going to stop kicking and screaming

541
00:21:40,249 --> 00:21:45,649
until I get it<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm going to get it and</font>

542
00:21:42,700 --> 00:21:48,350
not only is that a nice idea which would

543
00:21:45,648 --> 00:21:50,898
be great to talk about but I've done it

544
00:21:48,349 --> 00:21:52,278
my life is a byproduct of me saying I'm

545
00:21:50,898 --> 00:21:53,928
gonna<font color="#E5E5E5"> do what I want to do this is what</font>

546
00:21:52,278 --> 00:21:56,269
I want I'm gonna<font color="#E5E5E5"> go down kicking and</font>

547
00:21:53,929 --> 00:22:00,559
screaming I'll die before I not get what

548
00:21:56,269 --> 00:22:03,499
I set out to get I got it now the

549
00:22:00,558 --> 00:22:06,048
biggest<font color="#E5E5E5"> problem is what I want next and</font>

550
00:22:03,499 --> 00:22:07,669
it's it's doing him and it's it's it's

551
00:22:06,048 --> 00:22:08,929
it's not thinking about it and saying

552
00:22:07,669 --> 00:22:10,278
like<font color="#E5E5E5"> we have all these a lot of these</font>

553
00:22:08,929 --> 00:22:12,490
misconceptions that goes with the same

554
00:22:10,278 --> 00:22:14,898
thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> that you've been talking</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> about but</font>

555
00:22:12,490 --> 00:22:16,909
you know the secret and<font color="#E5E5E5"> all these things</font>

556
00:22:14,898 --> 00:22:19,308
<font color="#E5E5E5">I ask and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I shall be given to</font>

557
00:22:16,909 --> 00:22:21,739
like this<font color="#E5E5E5"> we we focus enough intent but</font>

558
00:22:19,308 --> 00:22:23,450
nothing happens without the action and a

lot of<font color="#E5E5E5"> times the people's words the</font>

things that we're saying a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of times</font>

561
00:22:26,028 --> 00:22:29,778
all we're really trying to do is

562
00:22:27,169 --> 00:22:32,629
describe what is fucking happening to us

563
00:22:29,778 --> 00:22:34,788
you know as opposed to coming up with a

564
00:22:32,628 --> 00:22:37,128
novel idea or anything<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's like well</font>

565
00:22:34,788 --> 00:22:38,989

here but<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're just describing some</font>

568
00:22:40,729 --> 00:22:44,569
abstract idea that<font color="#E5E5E5"> just happen to be</font>

569
00:22:42,048 --> 00:22:46,028
happening while you were haha what

570
00:22:44,569 --> 00:22:49,939

that's<font color="#CCCCCC"> amazing so we're talking about</font>

572
00:22:49,940 --> 00:22:55,308
this transition and unifying all this

573
00:22:54,138 --> 00:22:57,709
stuff let's talk about some of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the ways</font>

574
00:22:55,308 --> 00:23:00,319
that we the practical ways that we do

575
00:22:57,710 --> 00:23:04,009
<font color="#E5E5E5">this so what I'm referring to here is is</font>

576
00:23:00,319 --> 00:23:05,148
some of these natural we<font color="#E5E5E5"> talk natural</font>

577
00:23:04,009 --> 00:23:06,979
all the time we're always saying talking

578
00:23:05,148 --> 00:23:09,798
about nature and this and that so<font color="#CCCCCC"> we</font>

579
00:23:06,979 --> 00:23:13,729
have these four big huge natural

580
00:23:09,798 --> 00:23:16,759
elements noble elements if you will one

581
00:23:13,729 --> 00:23:18,798
of them is air right and so breathing

582
00:23:16,759 --> 00:23:22,179
things like that so how do we utilize

583
00:23:18,798 --> 00:23:27,489
the hand of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the universe and the hand of</font>

584
00:23:22,179 --> 00:23:30,950
nature to<font color="#CCCCCC"> begin to manifest this this</font>

585
00:23:27,489 --> 00:23:32,840
unification of our of our brain in our

586
00:23:30,950 --> 00:23:37,419
body or our brain in our hearts or

587

599
00:24:04,999 --> 00:24:10,129
else that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> like and unto my example of</font>

subscribes at your balls the way I

602
00:24:11,989 --> 00:24:15,798
describe it<font color="#E5E5E5"> is your head your heart and</font>

603
00:24:13,278 --> 00:24:19,128
balls you<font color="#CCCCCC"> got three minds essentially in</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">they call it the the different dime</font>

606
00:24:21,288 --> 00:24:28,940
tienes you know that upper lower admit

608
00:24:28,940 --> 00:24:35,890
says that guys

609
00:24:30,710 --> 00:24:39,140
got balls it's very indicative of what

610
00:24:35,890 --> 00:24:41,120
that actually means it means he's<font color="#E5E5E5"> going</font>

611

has balls is a guy that's going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to do</font>

613
00:24:43,069 --> 00:24:48,439
something so tying the whole thing

614
00:24:46,278 --> 00:24:51,950
together means accessing your Holy

615
00:24:48,440 --> 00:24:53,720
Spirit accessing your courage that's the

616
00:24:51,950 --> 00:24:55,220
<font color="#E5E5E5">whole thing you know the whole thing</font>

this happen because stories are very

635
00:25:38,509 --> 00:25:43,009
helpful<font color="#E5E5E5"> to us you know there's so many</font>

yourself you talk to<font color="#CCCCCC"> you talk yourself</font>

638
00:25:44,720 --> 00:25:52,269
into doing something but physiologically

639
00:25:48,429 --> 00:25:56,210
that looks like<font color="#E5E5E5"> being in your body</font>

640
00:25:52,269 --> 00:26:00,500
deeply enough comfortable in your skin

641
00:25:56,210 --> 00:26:02,298
they would say enough<font color="#CCCCCC"> to take action in</font>

642
00:26:00,500 --> 00:26:04,099
a particular direction now this is not

643
00:26:02,298 --> 00:26:05,599
your strategy you sometimes you've got

644
00:26:04,099 --> 00:26:07,759
to figure<font color="#E5E5E5"> out your strategy as</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you go</font>

645
00:26:05,599 --> 00:26:12,829
but you've got to be embodied enough

646
00:26:07,759 --> 00:26:15,819
courageous enough ballsy enough rooted

647
00:26:12,829 --> 00:26:19,730
enough in your own sexuality in your own

648
00:26:15,819 --> 00:26:23,720
beingness to just say I'm going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do it</font>

649
00:26:19,730 --> 00:26:26,240
and physiologically exercise wise what

650
00:26:23,720 --> 00:26:27,890
that looks like and mind you there<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font>

651
00:26:26,240 --> 00:26:29,960
is these<font color="#E5E5E5"> are ancient forms of exercise</font>

Gong and Tai Chi and yoga and the chakra

654

655
00:26:35,720 --> 00:26:39,380
know<font color="#CCCCCC"> woo mystical shit but it's like if</font>

656
00:26:38,210 --> 00:26:41,240
you really stop for a moment pay

657
00:26:39,380 --> 00:26:43,220
attention to it you'll realize it's

658
00:26:41,240 --> 00:26:44,240
pretty scientific and all the guys<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

659
00:26:43,220 --> 00:26:46,120
try<font color="#E5E5E5"> to prove it in the West</font>

660

you're a fucking quack but if I<font color="#E5E5E5"> could</font>

663
00:26:51,920 --> 00:26:56,750
<font color="#CCCCCC">describe</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it in the most practical</font>

664
00:26:53,210 --> 00:26:58,789
pragmatic terms it means breathing down

665
00:26:56,750 --> 00:27:00,019
into your pelvic floor and the only way

666
00:26:58,789 --> 00:27:01,869
you can breathe down into your pelvic

667
00:27:00,019 --> 00:27:05,269
floor so that you can embody all of the

668
00:27:01,869 --> 00:27:07,399
inspiration that comes is when you

669
00:27:05,269 --> 00:27:09,769
soften the muscular system around your

670
00:27:07,400 --> 00:27:12,710
jaw because this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is you bring in air</font>

671
00:27:09,769 --> 00:27:14,558
you're inspired right we like that word

672
00:27:12,710 --> 00:27:17,179
inspired inspiring doesn't happen<font color="#CCCCCC"> here</font>

673
00:27:14,558 --> 00:27:19,460
inspire is breathing in that's what it

674
00:27:17,179 --> 00:27:23,600
<font color="#CCCCCC">is spire spero is the word spirit</font>

675
00:27:19,460 --> 00:27:26,329
breathing it happens here and then

676
00:27:23,599 --> 00:27:28,339
there's a wave in our body then it moves

677
00:27:26,329 --> 00:27:30,889
down into our pelvic floor through our

678
00:27:28,339 --> 00:27:35,389
stomach into our chest and if<font color="#E5E5E5"> we have a</font>

679
00:27:30,890 --> 00:27:40,130
soft inspiration way a soft respiration

680
00:27:35,390 --> 00:27:42,770
wave we are grounded and we are sexual

681
00:27:40,130 --> 00:27:45,650
and we are confident and we're strong or

682
00:27:42,769 --> 00:27:48,289
what I call tender aggressive and when

683
00:27:45,650 --> 00:27:50,990
you come<font color="#CCCCCC"> from that state of tender</font>

684
00:27:48,289 --> 00:27:55,879
aggression you can totally attack the

685
00:27:50,990 --> 00:27:57,740
world with not a hint of second-guessing

686
00:27:55,880 --> 00:28:01,190
yourself it's just an attitude that

687
00:27:57,740 --> 00:28:02,720
comes with you I recently read this book

688

703
00:28:44,569 --> 00:28:48,289
and you don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> enjoy</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the fruits of your</font>

704
00:28:46,400 --> 00:28:49,820
labor so who cares if you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> a warrior</font>

705
00:28:48,289 --> 00:28:51,920
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> then on the on the flip side of it</font>

706
00:28:49,819 --> 00:28:53,418
who cares if you're just a you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know if</font>

707
00:28:51,920 --> 00:28:56,000
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> just enjoy life and you sit around</font>

708
00:28:53,419 --> 00:28:57,890
<font color="#E5E5E5">and join or whatever there's no there's</font>

709
00:28:56,000 --> 00:29:00,650
no balance between it all

710
00:28:57,890 --> 00:29:03,080
so though<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> complete the completeness</font>

711
00:29:00,650 --> 00:29:06,950
comes whenever you can do whenever you

712
00:29:03,079 --> 00:29:08,869
can do both then you got a time<font color="#E5E5E5"> all</font>

713
00:29:06,950 --> 00:29:11,029
together because I mentioned Wilhelm

right before they put him<font color="#E5E5E5"> in jail you</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">got</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> fucking</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> died in jail because you</font>

716
00:29:12,410 --> 00:29:15,080
know he was a crazy dude but he was

717
00:29:13,819 --> 00:29:19,939
basically trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to prove the existence</font>

718
00:29:15,079 --> 00:29:21,619
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> Chi he called it or go but um</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> but he</font>

719
00:29:19,940 --> 00:29:23,779
described and the other thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> was he was</font>

720
00:29:21,619 --> 00:29:26,029
highly sexually charged all of his books

721
00:29:23,779 --> 00:29:29,210
<font color="#E5E5E5">and all of his he basically created the</font>

722
00:29:26,029 --> 00:29:33,049
sexual revolution in the 60s with his

723
00:29:29,210 --> 00:29:35,539
books but<font color="#E5E5E5"> the way he often described the</font>

724
00:29:33,049 --> 00:29:38,960
energy flowing processes in an

725
00:29:35,539 --> 00:29:41,930
individual was in how they had sex and

726
00:29:38,960 --> 00:29:43,579
he basically was like you can basically

727
00:29:41,930 --> 00:29:45,410
you can look at someone and see how

728
00:29:43,579 --> 00:29:47,089
their energy is distributed in their

729
00:29:45,410 --> 00:29:50,570
their physique he called a character

too rigid the phthalic narcissist the

734
00:29:58,839 --> 00:30:06,439
and for females it would be be the<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

00:30:02,650 --> 00:30:08,900
the neurotic type for both is a

variations thereof I'm giving you just

752
00:30:43,220 --> 00:30:49,610
different extremes the oral type is also

753
00:30:45,829 --> 00:30:53,049
dubbed the lover very soft<font color="#E5E5E5"> very like</font>

754
00:30:49,609 --> 00:30:56,059
loving you know doesn't make<font color="#E5E5E5"> any enemies</font>

755
00:30:53,049 --> 00:30:58,700
friends<font color="#E5E5E5"> with</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> everyone easy to get along</font>

756
00:30:56,059 --> 00:31:00,019
with they're almost like you can't help

757
00:30:58,700 --> 00:31:04,819
but fall in love with them they're<font color="#CCCCCC"> just</font>

758
00:31:00,019 --> 00:31:06,349
nice they're just<font color="#E5E5E5"> really nice sexually</font>

759
00:31:04,819 --> 00:31:08,950
that guy<font color="#E5E5E5"> because we're just talking in</font>

760
00:31:06,349 --> 00:31:10,990
terms of men the type of guy that can

761
00:31:08,950 --> 00:31:12,490
<font color="#E5E5E5">probably get it up</font>

762
00:31:10,990 --> 00:31:14,679
because he's kind of<font color="#CCCCCC"> laid back enough</font>

763
00:31:12,490 --> 00:31:16,329
it's tender enough but he's the kind of

764
00:31:14,679 --> 00:31:19,630
guy that will<font color="#E5E5E5"> never have a good orgasm</font>

765
00:31:16,329 --> 00:31:23,409
he'll just keep going he can<font color="#E5E5E5"> stroke for</font>

766
00:31:19,630 --> 00:31:25,360
like half an hour hour goes by when it's

767
00:31:23,410 --> 00:31:29,259
like when he realizes his girlfriend's

768
00:31:25,359 --> 00:31:33,579
board he's like all right I guess I got

769
00:31:29,259 --> 00:31:35,950
to ejaculate and it comes<font color="#E5E5E5"> up one has too</font>

770
00:31:33,579 --> 00:31:39,579
much charge the other one has no charge

771
00:31:35,950 --> 00:31:42,910
at all or a very low charge the balance

772
00:31:39,579 --> 00:31:44,500
is where your I'm aggressive<font color="#E5E5E5"> enough to</font>

773
00:31:42,910 --> 00:31:46,980
go after and get what I want because

774
00:31:44,500 --> 00:31:49,630
I've got spine I've got I've got

775
00:31:46,980 --> 00:31:53,558
aggression and that's very sexual but at

776
00:31:49,630 --> 00:31:59,800
<font color="#E5E5E5">the same time I know how to breathe I'm</font>

777
00:31:53,558 --> 00:32:01,690
saw um Alexander Lowen broke down the

778
00:31:59,799 --> 00:32:03,190
body in this way<font color="#E5E5E5"> he said that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

779
00:32:01,690 --> 00:32:05,380
tenderness and if you look at a dog

780
00:32:03,190 --> 00:32:07,029
right the dog is very tender here the

781
00:32:05,380 --> 00:32:09,429
tenderness happens in the front<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the</font>

782
00:32:07,029 --> 00:32:11,529
body<font color="#E5E5E5"> the aggression happens up the back</font>

783
00:32:09,429 --> 00:32:12,670
of the body so if you imagine like when

784
00:32:11,529 --> 00:32:14,289
a dog<font color="#CCCCCC"> gets angry what does it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> do</font>

785
00:32:12,670 --> 00:32:15,850
attention up its muscles back well we

786
00:32:14,289 --> 00:32:18,190
get frustrated<font color="#CCCCCC"> angry tense up our back</font>

787
00:32:15,849 --> 00:32:20,829
they say you<font color="#E5E5E5"> have your back up and then</font>

788
00:32:18,190 --> 00:32:22,570
when someone's very relaxed and soft<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

789
00:32:20,829 --> 00:32:25,089
<font color="#E5E5E5">or belly like a dog when the dog wants</font>

790
00:32:22,569 --> 00:32:27,759
<font color="#E5E5E5">to love you what does he do shows you</font>

791
00:32:25,089 --> 00:32:29,049
his belly so we've got to balance this

792
00:32:27,759 --> 00:32:30,339
and that's why strength training fucks

793
00:32:29,049 --> 00:32:31,839
this up in so many ways I can't really

794
00:32:30,339 --> 00:32:33,730
body bill too much anymore because I get

795
00:32:31,839 --> 00:32:35,319
all tense here<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm gonna try to just do</font>

796
00:32:33,730 --> 00:32:38,410
deadlifts and build<font color="#E5E5E5"> up my aggression and</font>

797
00:32:35,319 --> 00:32:41,079
then just stretch and soften and tap all

798
00:32:38,410 --> 00:32:43,150
this I tap and stretch and soften I make

799
00:32:41,079 --> 00:32:44,980
this as soft as I can make this as hard

800
00:32:43,150 --> 00:32:46,990
as I can so when I come at you with the

801
00:32:44,980 --> 00:32:49,170
aggression that you like I'm at my<font color="#CCCCCC"> woman</font>

854
00:34:45,099 --> 00:34:48,190
<font color="#E5E5E5">we'll drift over to the aggression side</font>

man a balance of becoming I think a huge

858
00:34:53,769 --> 00:34:59,380
part of it is self-aware which I guess

859
00:34:56,530 --> 00:35:00,820
<font color="#CCCCCC">can only come with experience more</font>

860

that rules the world it's the male

868
00:35:15,579 --> 00:35:20,529
energy that's ruling our world and we're

869
00:35:17,650 --> 00:35:24,280
living at such a time of Go Go Go

870
00:35:20,530 --> 00:35:27,550
aggression more bigger beat war more

871
00:35:24,280 --> 00:35:29,980
usual thing so to be living<font color="#CCCCCC"> in a time</font>

872
00:35:27,550 --> 00:35:33,570
where that's the dominant energy it's

873
00:35:29,980 --> 00:35:37,030
very difficult to just love relax

880
00:35:51,460 --> 00:35:55,059
and so aggressive we have<font color="#E5E5E5"> things like</font>

881

885
00:36:01,210 --> 00:36:05,769
became so head dominant because it

886
00:36:03,248 --> 00:36:08,169
became so male and if you look at

887
00:36:05,768 --> 00:36:09,879
countries like India where like you know

888
00:36:08,170 --> 00:36:11,619

00:36:15,248 --> 00:36:19,778
being prejudiced in a way but they don't

893
00:36:18,518 --> 00:36:21,488
die<font color="#CCCCCC"> of heart attacks but it's like one</font>

894
00:36:19,778 --> 00:36:23,139
of the same time it's like but they

895

heart attacks cancer and impotence and

901
00:36:34,539 --> 00:36:39,130

903
00:36:39,130 --> 00:36:42,130
everybody's kind of poor but they're

925
00:37:30,068 --> 00:37:36,248
yeah so let's<font color="#E5E5E5"> talk</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> about the another one</font>

926
00:37:33,338 --> 00:37:38,469
of these noble elements or natural

927
00:37:36,248 --> 00:37:43,929
forces water so water is hugely

928
00:37:38,469 --> 00:37:45,999
important to life<font color="#E5E5E5"> right yeah absolutely</font>

929
00:37:43,929 --> 00:37:48,219
i mean we're made up of water<font color="#E5E5E5"> right what</font>

930
00:37:45,998 --> 00:37:50,949
is it<font color="#E5E5E5"> like 90 / saw diaz water i once</font>

931
00:37:48,219 --> 00:37:52,059
heard it described the human being as

932
00:37:50,949 --> 00:37:55,798
being

933
00:37:52,059 --> 00:37:58,269
a big hairy sack of water with teeth

934
00:37:55,798 --> 00:38:03,119
that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay that's pretty</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> much</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> what we</font>

935
00:37:58,268 --> 00:38:06,429
are yeah<font color="#CCCCCC"> we carry sacks of water yeah a</font>

936
00:38:03,119 --> 00:38:08,949
lot of a lot of that still doesn't

937
00:38:06,429 --> 00:38:11,649
register for a lot of<font color="#E5E5E5"> people</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> right like</font>

938
00:38:08,949 --> 00:38:14,019
it doesn't register on on a couple of a

939
00:38:11,650 --> 00:38:15,160
couple of ways for one we're still not

940
00:38:14,018 --> 00:38:18,548
drinking that much<font color="#E5E5E5"> water you know you</font>

941
00:38:15,159 --> 00:38:21,429
see people walking around with<font color="#CCCCCC"> you know</font>

942
00:38:18,548 --> 00:38:22,659
coffee and sodas and sports drinks and

943
00:38:21,429 --> 00:38:27,129
energy drinks things like this<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> then</font>

944
00:38:22,659 --> 00:38:29,879
on the other side we are totally void

945
00:38:27,130 --> 00:38:33,579
for the most part of quality<font color="#CCCCCC"> of water</font>

946
00:38:29,880 --> 00:38:35,410
and and then we can go<font color="#CCCCCC"> into it even</font>

947
00:38:33,579 --> 00:38:37,539
<font color="#E5E5E5">further so I don't know if you've seen</font>

948
00:38:35,409 --> 00:38:39,489
you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> I watch this documentary</font>

949
00:38:37,539 --> 00:38:42,069
recently talking about water and how

950
00:38:39,489 --> 00:38:46,228
water we don't basically don't know shit

951
00:38:42,068 --> 00:38:50,798
about water scientifically right so

952
00:38:46,228 --> 00:38:53,858
water has can carry memories water can

953
00:38:50,798 --> 00:38:56,048
be structured or unstructured coherent

954
00:38:53,858 --> 00:38:57,989
you know all these different terms and

955
00:38:56,048 --> 00:39:00,998
things that we can carry information

956
00:38:57,989 --> 00:39:03,728
within water and water you know all

957
00:39:00,998 --> 00:39:05,798
these different<font color="#E5E5E5"> crazy things and it</font>

958
00:39:03,728 --> 00:39:09,149
seems<font color="#E5E5E5"> like we just not we're not up to</font>

959
00:39:05,798 --> 00:39:13,449
speed with many things about water yet

960
00:39:09,150 --> 00:39:15,009
we might not understand here and that

961
00:39:13,449 --> 00:39:16,389
word understand i'm talking<font color="#CCCCCC"> like that</font>

962
00:39:15,009 --> 00:39:18,159
word a lot lately because it's like you

963
00:39:16,389 --> 00:39:19,719
know understand what is that what do<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

964
00:39:18,159 --> 00:39:21,818
call it understand like we're standing

965
00:39:19,719 --> 00:39:23,650
under I think understand is actually a

966
00:39:21,818 --> 00:39:25,688
bodily experience because it's like<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's</font>

967
00:39:23,650 --> 00:39:27,939
standing under<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's like underneath that</font>

968
00:39:25,688 --> 00:39:32,409
which is<font color="#E5E5E5"> above so anyway that's just my</font>

969
00:39:27,938 --> 00:39:35,228
weirdness but<font color="#E5E5E5"> um I if we embody things I</font>

970
00:39:32,409 --> 00:39:37,328
<font color="#E5E5E5">think we we don't have to think about it</font>

971
00:39:35,228 --> 00:39:38,739
we don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> need any facts about it you</font>

972
00:39:37,329 --> 00:39:40,929
know<font color="#E5E5E5"> if we're living enough in our</font>

973
00:39:38,739 --> 00:39:42,728
bodies but we our energy has moved so

974
00:39:40,929 --> 00:39:44,139
far up into our heads that we don't feel

975
00:39:42,728 --> 00:39:46,088
what's happening in our bodies the

976
00:39:44,139 --> 00:39:49,328
easiest way that I could describe<font color="#CCCCCC"> what</font>

977
00:39:46,088 --> 00:39:51,159
happens so<font color="#E5E5E5"> that you have a you know an</font>

978
00:39:49,329 --> 00:39:52,239
abstract idea so that you can say maybe

979
00:39:51,159 --> 00:39:54,068
I<font color="#E5E5E5"> should bring some drink some water</font>

980
00:39:52,239 --> 00:39:55,179
besides the fact that you probably feel

981
00:39:54,068 --> 00:39:57,728
like shit but<font color="#E5E5E5"> you don't know</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

982
00:39:55,179 --> 00:39:59,858
feel like shit is how is it what's the

983
00:39:57,728 --> 00:40:01,928
fastest<font color="#CCCCCC"> way</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> for electricity to to move</font>

984
00:39:59,858 --> 00:40:05,528
<font color="#E5E5E5">it's through water right i mean you drop</font>

985
00:40:01,929 --> 00:40:05,829
you drop a electricity you know a live

986
00:40:05,528 --> 00:40:07,690
why

987
00:40:05,829 --> 00:40:10,359
into water that whole thing sparks<font color="#CCCCCC"> like</font>

988
00:40:07,690 --> 00:40:12,458
instantly<font color="#CCCCCC"> yeah</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> right water travel I mean</font>

989
00:40:10,358 --> 00:40:16,389
electricity track almost fastest through

990
00:40:12,458 --> 00:40:18,129
water if you consider and of<font color="#CCCCCC"> course</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

991
00:40:16,389 --> 00:40:19,598
know there are different ways you can

992
00:40:18,130 --> 00:40:21,548
describe<font color="#E5E5E5"> it but that our nervous system</font>

993
00:40:19,599 --> 00:40:23,559
is literally<font color="#E5E5E5"> another as our electrical</font>

994
00:40:21,548 --> 00:40:25,179
system it's the<font color="#CCCCCC"> fast-moving system in</font>

995
00:40:23,559 --> 00:40:27,219
<font color="#E5E5E5">our bodies not our hormonal system which</font>

996
00:40:25,179 --> 00:40:30,298
is slow moving these neural transmitters

997
00:40:27,219 --> 00:40:32,679
and the connections between them are

998
00:40:30,298 --> 00:40:34,059
right<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think about doing this and it</font>

999
00:40:32,679 --> 00:40:36,149
happened boom boom boom<font color="#CCCCCC"> you know</font>

1000
00:40:34,059 --> 00:40:39,940
<font color="#E5E5E5">somebody something drops on my toe</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> mook</font>

1001
00:40:36,150 --> 00:40:43,989
it's quick<font color="#E5E5E5"> as a three but if there is</font>

1002
00:40:39,940 --> 00:40:46,358
not enough of the carrier<font color="#E5E5E5"> of electrical</font>

1003
00:40:43,989 --> 00:40:48,190
<font color="#CCCCCC">impulses from your you know a fairly</font>

1004
00:40:46,358 --> 00:40:50,858
apparently then there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to be a</font>

1005
00:40:48,190 --> 00:40:52,989
lag in response you're not going to be

1006
00:40:50,858 --> 00:40:57,248
as smart you're not going to be as quick

1007
00:40:52,989 --> 00:40:58,179
you're not going to be as vital healthy

1008
00:40:57,248 --> 00:41:00,788
you just you're not gonna be as

1009
00:40:58,179 --> 00:41:01,929
intelligent if you don't have water in

1010
00:41:00,789 --> 00:41:03,459
your body<font color="#E5E5E5"> because your brain your</font>

1011
00:41:01,929 --> 00:41:06,129
nervous system cannot work your

1012
00:41:03,458 --> 00:41:08,169
electrical system has too much viscosity

1013
00:41:06,130 --> 00:41:11,079
because there's not<font color="#CCCCCC"> enough water</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> in it</font>

1014
00:41:08,170 --> 00:41:12,699
so if you want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be smarter you want to</font>

1015
00:41:11,079 --> 00:41:14,019
think better if you want to have you

1016
00:41:12,699 --> 00:41:16,479
want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be stronger because ever</font>

1017
00:41:14,018 --> 00:41:17,828
basically all<font color="#CCCCCC"> of this all these things</font>

1018
00:41:16,478 --> 00:41:19,659
<font color="#CCCCCC">are functions to the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> nervous system</font>

1019
00:41:17,829 --> 00:41:20,829
<font color="#E5E5E5">would have better sex won't have a</font>

1020
00:41:19,659 --> 00:41:22,568
<font color="#E5E5E5">better life you want to make more money</font>

1021
00:41:20,829 --> 00:41:25,359
drink little<font color="#E5E5E5"> fucking water because your</font>

1022
00:41:22,568 --> 00:41:27,608
electrical system will work better we

1023
00:41:25,358 --> 00:41:29,288
had a guy on recently Jack crews who's

1024
00:41:27,608 --> 00:41:30,608
talking about water and he was talking

1025
00:41:29,289 --> 00:41:32,109
<font color="#CCCCCC">about fluoride and he's talking about</font>

1026
00:41:30,608 --> 00:41:34,328
how fluoride is a dielectric blocker

1027
00:41:32,108 --> 00:41:36,038
like that's why we have this big thing

1028
00:41:34,329 --> 00:41:38,140
<font color="#E5E5E5">about fluoride nobody knows why it's</font>

1029
00:41:36,039 --> 00:41:40,420
good or bad or why it's there why<font color="#E5E5E5"> is it</font>

1030
00:41:38,139 --> 00:41:42,190
in our water<font color="#CCCCCC"> and this and that well what</font>

1031
00:41:40,420 --> 00:41:43,239
he says is that this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is a dielectric</font>

1032
00:41:42,190 --> 00:41:44,318
blocker so goes right in with what

1033
00:41:43,239 --> 00:41:45,789
you're<font color="#CCCCCC"> saying is it doesn't allow</font>

1034
00:41:44,318 --> 00:41:50,108
electricity to flow through the water

1035
00:41:45,789 --> 00:41:51,670
like it should wow really that's

1036
00:41:50,108 --> 00:41:53,139
<font color="#E5E5E5">fascinating i have heard many different</font>

1037
00:41:51,670 --> 00:41:56,229
things about why it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not good but</font>

1038
00:41:53,139 --> 00:41:57,670
that's a new one to me yeah why do<font color="#E5E5E5"> we</font>

1039
00:41:56,228 --> 00:41:59,828
have to scoot why are we so smart that

1040
00:41:57,670 --> 00:42:03,400
we gotta screw with what mother nature's

1041
00:41:59,829 --> 00:42:05,499
<font color="#CCCCCC">most plentiful element on this earth is</font>

1042
00:42:03,400 --> 00:42:06,910
like we got to<font color="#E5E5E5"> make it better right here</font>

1043
00:42:05,498 --> 00:42:07,929
we go human beings always trying to<font color="#E5E5E5"> make</font>

1044
00:42:06,909 --> 00:42:09,608
shit better it's like oh we're gonna

1045
00:42:07,929 --> 00:42:13,328
make water better by adding shit to<font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font>

1046
00:42:09,608 --> 00:42:15,818
yeah you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> and I'm ranting I had too</font>

1047
00:42:13,329 --> 00:42:17,380
much coffee today anyway but you know

1048
00:42:15,818 --> 00:42:18,909
you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> always argue depending on your</font>

1049
00:42:17,380 --> 00:42:19,568
philosophical standpoint you can always

1050
00:42:18,909 --> 00:42:22,899
argue

1051
00:42:19,568 --> 00:42:25,869
that oh but human beings we we do so<font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font>

1052
00:42:22,900 --> 00:42:27,639
such good by reading the water of the

1053
00:42:25,869 --> 00:42:31,599
bacteria's and the viruses and the

1054
00:42:27,639 --> 00:42:34,058
pathogens that make us sick<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay but</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font>

1055
00:42:31,599 --> 00:42:35,259
depends on if you look at it<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> way</font>

1056
00:42:34,059 --> 00:42:38,289
you're looking<font color="#E5E5E5"> at it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> from a very</font>

1057
00:42:35,259 --> 00:42:40,239
egocentric point of view you're looking

1058
00:42:38,289 --> 00:42:42,309
at it<font color="#CCCCCC"> as well we're better organisms</font>

1059
00:42:40,239 --> 00:42:44,139
were more important than the parasites

1060
00:42:42,309 --> 00:42:45,400
right and of course we<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't want to die</font>

1061
00:42:44,139 --> 00:42:48,328
that's our biggest problem is that<font color="#E5E5E5"> were</font>

1062
00:42:45,400 --> 00:42:52,269
we're so afraid of our mortality that

1063
00:42:48,329 --> 00:42:55,028
<font color="#CCCCCC">we've created</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a situation now where we</font>

1064
00:42:52,268 --> 00:42:56,198
don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> die in fact we're not even allowed</font>

1065
00:42:55,028 --> 00:42:58,119
to die if somebody was to<font color="#E5E5E5"> take his own</font>

1066
00:42:56,199 --> 00:43:00,180
life he's like it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> illegal can't</font>

1067
00:42:58,119 --> 00:43:03,278
fucking take<font color="#CCCCCC"> your life it allowed to die</font>

1068
00:43:00,179 --> 00:43:05,048
right and we've gotten rid of so many

1069
00:43:03,278 --> 00:43:07,208
pathogens at<font color="#E5E5E5"> least we think we have</font>

1070
00:43:05,048 --> 00:43:08,858
we've<font color="#E5E5E5"> just made them come back stronger</font>

1071
00:43:07,208 --> 00:43:11,108
<font color="#CCCCCC">and we got to keep fighting</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> them because</font>

1072
00:43:08,858 --> 00:43:12,670
you can't beat nature so it's kind of

1073
00:43:11,108 --> 00:43:14,798
like masturbation you could set you

1074
00:43:12,670 --> 00:43:19,838
could say<font color="#E5E5E5"> to yourself yes we've done so</font>

1075
00:43:14,798 --> 00:43:22,869
much good by impeding the infection of

1076
00:43:19,838 --> 00:43:24,670
our bodies by these pathogens but also

1077
00:43:22,869 --> 00:43:26,318
you could say yeah but you know what you

1078
00:43:24,670 --> 00:43:27,548
also<font color="#CCCCCC"> made them stronger and eventually</font>

1079
00:43:26,318 --> 00:43:30,940
they're going to come<font color="#E5E5E5"> back</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and kick our</font>

1080
00:43:27,548 --> 00:43:33,038
asses<font color="#CCCCCC"> 10 times harder whenever we fuck</font>

1081
00:43:30,940 --> 00:43:35,708
with nature we get fucked up you can't

1082
00:43:33,039 --> 00:43:38,469
progress is an illusion it does this

1083
00:43:35,708 --> 00:43:39,909
like we're<font color="#CCCCCC"> talking about ok good Oh</font>

1084
00:43:38,469 --> 00:43:42,369
looks<font color="#E5E5E5"> like you're winning it looks like</font>

1085
00:43:39,909 --> 00:43:43,659
you're winning<font color="#CCCCCC"> on till you lose</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it looks</font>

1086
00:43:42,369 --> 00:43:46,900
like you're losing<font color="#E5E5E5"> your losing you're</font>

1087
00:43:43,659 --> 00:43:48,429
losing you losing until you win we can't

1088
00:43:46,900 --> 00:43:50,709
get attached<font color="#E5E5E5"> to one part of it winning</font>

1089
00:43:48,429 --> 00:43:53,828
is all we want oh we beat the pathogens

1090
00:43:50,708 --> 00:43:55,389
they'll fool yourself news the pathogens

1091
00:43:53,829 --> 00:43:58,449
are coming back like they got these they

1092
00:43:55,389 --> 00:44:01,389
call him like like monster terms yeah

1093
00:43:58,449 --> 00:44:03,940
damn right<font color="#E5E5E5"> mocks adjourn go earth though</font>

1094
00:44:01,389 --> 00:44:06,338
nature come and get us cuz it's just

1095
00:44:03,940 --> 00:44:08,829
part of the fucking process I was

1096
00:44:06,338 --> 00:44:11,048
listening<font color="#E5E5E5"> to this daniel quinn he wrote</font>

1097
00:44:08,829 --> 00:44:13,239
the book<font color="#E5E5E5"> ish mile and all these all</font>

1098
00:44:11,048 --> 00:44:14,920
these uh really cool books and that's

1099
00:44:13,239 --> 00:44:18,249
what he was talking about<font color="#E5E5E5"> is we became</font>

1100
00:44:14,920 --> 00:44:21,159
scared of death and we started seeing we

1101
00:44:18,248 --> 00:44:22,328
started to to produce agriculture and

1102
00:44:21,159 --> 00:44:23,469
things like<font color="#CCCCCC"> this and now we're at this</font>

1103
00:44:22,329 --> 00:44:27,969
point to where we're trying to kill

1104
00:44:23,469 --> 00:44:29,889
every pest every weed everything<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

1105
00:44:27,969 --> 00:44:31,630
<font color="#E5E5E5">it's in turn has done exactly what</font>

1106
00:44:29,889 --> 00:44:33,038
you're saying has increased<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

1107
00:44:31,630 --> 00:44:34,900
population to

1108
00:44:33,039 --> 00:44:36,309
point to where we don't die and we need

1109
00:44:34,900 --> 00:44:38,559
this food now because<font color="#E5E5E5"> there's so many</font>

1110
00:44:36,309 --> 00:44:40,209
<font color="#E5E5E5">people and the more the more food the</font>

1111
00:44:38,559 --> 00:44:43,900
more people going back and forth so

1112
00:44:40,208 --> 00:44:45,698
we're like racing to our death and at

1113
00:44:43,900 --> 00:44:49,088
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> same time you know we're eliminating</font>

1114
00:44:45,699 --> 00:44:51,579
all these all of<font color="#CCCCCC"> these organisms that</font>

1115
00:44:49,088 --> 00:44:54,278
are essential to our survival because

1116
00:44:51,579 --> 00:44:57,640
we're trying to survive<font color="#E5E5E5"> we want to win</font>

1117
00:44:54,278 --> 00:44:59,949
it's so crazy you cannot win just stop

1118
00:44:57,639 --> 00:45:01,179
we need to just<font color="#E5E5E5"> stop we're not gonna</font>

1119
00:44:59,949 --> 00:45:03,338
stop because a lot of money invested in

1120
00:45:01,179 --> 00:45:06,278
<font color="#E5E5E5">all this shit so masturbation we're just</font>

1121
00:45:03,338 --> 00:45:07,748
playing with ourselves huh we can't take

1122
00:45:06,278 --> 00:45:10,028
<font color="#CCCCCC">any this shit too seriously you know</font>

1123
00:45:07,748 --> 00:45:11,678
people<font color="#E5E5E5"> people don't like me to may argue</font>

1124
00:45:10,028 --> 00:45:15,518
with me like Elliott Hulse like I'm kind

1177
00:47:13,099 --> 00:47:18,380
used to try to fight against where we're

1178
00:47:16,849 --> 00:47:20,420
going as a culture like you know too

1179

you want to go against and then finally

1260
00:50:22,610 --> 00:50:26,840
you realize that that is all you as well

1261
00:50:24,349 --> 00:50:28,069
or it's it's that's that dragon inside

1262
00:50:26,840 --> 00:50:29,600
of you that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> that you're fighting</font>

1263
00:50:28,070 --> 00:50:31,789
<font color="#E5E5E5">against me you realize if you just</font>

1264
00:50:29,599 --> 00:50:34,279
accept it all just like you said<font color="#E5E5E5"> like we</font>

1265
00:50:31,789 --> 00:50:35,980
are not we are not<font color="#E5E5E5"> different from nature</font>

1266
00:50:34,280 --> 00:50:39,320
we are not outside of nature trying to

1267
00:50:35,980 --> 00:50:41,360
<font color="#E5E5E5">do this or do that we are</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> nature so as</font>

1268
00:50:39,320 --> 00:50:42,590
soon<font color="#E5E5E5"> as we realize that we are then</font>

1269
00:50:41,360 --> 00:50:44,510
maybe<font color="#E5E5E5"> we can kind of get on with our</font>

1270
00:50:42,590 --> 00:50:46,400
existence and be able to<font color="#E5E5E5"> dance a little</font>

1271
00:50:44,510 --> 00:50:50,000
bit more rather<font color="#E5E5E5"> than looking for the</font>

1272
00:50:46,400 --> 00:50:53,119
time to where we can defeat culture or

1273
00:50:50,000 --> 00:50:55,159
defeat these earth these uh you know

1274
00:50:53,119 --> 00:50:56,809
<font color="#E5E5E5">monsanto and these big companies and</font>

1275
00:50:55,159 --> 00:50:59,179
these<font color="#E5E5E5"> things like this what we call it</font>

1276
00:50:56,809 --> 00:51:01,250
bad and there we go<font color="#CCCCCC"> again with this with</font>

1277
00:50:59,179 --> 00:51:03,889
this contrast we call it bad<font color="#E5E5E5"> but it's</font>

1278
00:51:01,250 --> 00:51:05,659
like do you know that it's bad<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay</font>

1279
00:51:03,889 --> 00:51:08,210
what's they're doing some strange weird

1280
00:51:05,659 --> 00:51:09,469
shit of course it's it's very abstract

1281
00:51:08,210 --> 00:51:11,269
it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> very strange</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> mean they're</font>

1282
00:51:09,469 --> 00:51:12,980
splicing animals with the crop and it's

1283
00:51:11,269 --> 00:51:13,400
like and like they're finding that it's

1284
00:51:12,980 --> 00:51:16,579
like make

1285
00:51:13,400 --> 00:51:18,320
turn<font color="#E5E5E5"> into like half mutants but it's</font>

1286
00:51:16,579 --> 00:51:21,799
like well maybe that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> what earth wants</font>

1287
00:51:18,320 --> 00:51:23,809
do maybe maybe nature wants us to fuck

1288
00:51:21,800 --> 00:51:25,670
with the DNA and then turn us into life

1289
00:51:23,809 --> 00:51:27,860
mutants<font color="#E5E5E5"> maybe like the next incarnation</font>

1290
00:51:25,670 --> 00:51:30,349
of human beings is gonna have like gills

1291
00:51:27,860 --> 00:51:31,160
and then we could thank now Monsanto for

1292
00:51:30,349 --> 00:51:32,659
<font color="#CCCCCC">the fact that we could breathe</font>

1293
00:51:31,159 --> 00:51:35,629
underwater now but will be fucked up<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

1294
00:51:32,659 --> 00:51:38,599
land let's go on a bus I don't know why

1295
00:51:35,630 --> 00:51:40,460
why am I gonna fight it's happening if I

1296
00:51:38,599 --> 00:51:42,679
have a vote out because I'm conservative

1297
00:51:40,460 --> 00:51:45,500
to a degree if I have a vote I'll be

1298
00:51:42,679 --> 00:51:47,269
like no I'd rather not because I kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

1299
00:51:45,500 --> 00:51:51,019
like the way things are but that's also

1300
00:51:47,269 --> 00:51:52,489
being a impeding to evolution and I

1301
00:51:51,019 --> 00:51:56,360
don't know what evolution is it's going

1302
00:51:52,489 --> 00:52:00,859
<font color="#E5E5E5">to happen why fight that makes a lot of</font>

1303
00:51:56,360 --> 00:52:04,550
sense it's um it goes back<font color="#CCCCCC"> to that thing</font>

1304
00:52:00,860 --> 00:52:06,380
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> you're saying just just living in</font>

1305
00:52:04,550 --> 00:52:08,780
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> mystery and enjoying it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> cuz we have</font>

1306
00:52:06,380 --> 00:52:10,820
this idea of a singularity man's always

1307
00:52:08,780 --> 00:52:12,740
popping up and you know how we're gonna

1308
00:52:10,820 --> 00:52:15,080
merge with machine and create all these

1309
00:52:12,739 --> 00:52:18,049
fucking crazy<font color="#CCCCCC"> BOTS and all this stuff</font>

1310
00:52:15,079 --> 00:52:20,779
and and it's it's sometimes<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's scary</font>

1311
00:52:18,050 --> 00:52:23,570
to entertain those thoughts but not when

1312
00:52:20,780 --> 00:52:26,060
you let go<font color="#E5E5E5"> of it you know not when you</font>

1313
00:52:23,570 --> 00:52:28,340
cut let go<font color="#E5E5E5"> and then just let</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> see and</font>

00:52:26,059 --> 00:52:31,639
just<font color="#E5E5E5"> do what you enjoy doing you know I</font>

1315
00:52:28,340 --> 00:52:34,220

know we all always have in these little

1318
00:52:35,780 --> 00:52:41,330
quarrels within ourselves or hopefully

1319
00:52:38,090 --> 00:52:42,559
not always but so I go on and listen to

1320

1350
00:53:50,630 --> 00:53:57,099
right Elliot so give us a give us to end

1351
00:53:52,969 --> 00:54:00,768
us out here give us something tangible

1352
00:53:57,099 --> 00:54:03,019
when it comes to getting from<font color="#E5E5E5"> our head</font>

1353
00:54:00,768 --> 00:54:05,238
and I know you you you<font color="#CCCCCC"> have you've</font>

1354
00:54:03,018 --> 00:54:07,219
talked about this already but something

1355
00:54:05,239 --> 00:54:09,619
<font color="#CCCCCC">that we can do to get from</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> our head and</font>

1356
00:54:07,219 --> 00:54:13,328
we can practice from our head into our

1357
00:54:09,619 --> 00:54:16,599
bodies breathing technique that you do a

1358
00:54:13,329 --> 00:54:22,190
bioenergetic technique that you do

1359
00:54:16,599 --> 00:54:23,930
whatever<font color="#E5E5E5"> I started out and I have an</font>

1360
00:54:22,190 --> 00:54:26,239
analogy for this meditation and

1361
00:54:23,929 --> 00:54:28,489
bioenergetics and bioenergetics is not

1362
00:54:26,239 --> 00:54:30,108
very<font color="#CCCCCC"> different than a lot of the the</font>

1363
00:54:28,489 --> 00:54:32,659
movement meditations of East

1364
00:54:30,108 --> 00:54:36,018
particularly yoga I've been<font color="#E5E5E5"> doing a lot</font>

1365
00:54:32,659 --> 00:54:36,949
of Olympic lifting lately and I<font color="#E5E5E5"> really</font>

1366
00:54:36,018 --> 00:54:38,659
part of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the reason</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> why I chose it</font>

1367
00:54:36,949 --> 00:54:40,969
because I knew I'm going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be really</font>

1368
00:54:38,659 --> 00:54:43,278
<font color="#CCCCCC">good at these lifts I gotta stretch lots</font>

1369
00:54:40,969 --> 00:54:44,629
so it was kind of an excuse for<font color="#E5E5E5"> me</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> not</font>

1370
00:54:43,278 --> 00:54:46,309
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> go to yoga class because I didn't</font>

1371
00:54:44,630 --> 00:54:48,950
have<font color="#E5E5E5"> the time but force myself to</font>

1372
00:54:46,309 --> 00:54:52,009
stretch a lot so I can lift anyway so

1373
00:54:48,949 --> 00:54:55,129
that it there is a way to do it by

1374
00:54:52,009 --> 00:54:57,829
turning off the brain<font color="#E5E5E5"> I found that for</font>

1375
00:54:55,130 --> 00:54:59,720
myself and most people<font color="#CCCCCC"> i know it doesn't</font>

1376
00:54:57,829 --> 00:55:02,210
work so easy and that's meditation

1377
00:54:59,719 --> 00:55:04,219
that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> basically just sit quietly and</font>

1378
00:55:02,210 --> 00:55:06,139
turn your brain off and if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you and</font>

1379
00:55:04,219 --> 00:55:08,568
because we as we described before the

1380
00:55:06,139 --> 00:55:10,308
brain is in your body one of the very

1381
00:55:08,568 --> 00:55:12,288
first ways you're going to find

1382
00:55:10,309 --> 00:55:15,470
meditation happening is when you stop

1383
00:55:12,289 --> 00:55:16,430
twitching you stop tensing your muscle

1384
00:55:15,469 --> 00:55:18,828
you're sitting there you're feet are

1385
00:55:16,429 --> 00:55:20,509
tapping or your hands are tied or you're

1386
00:55:18,829 --> 00:55:22,309
squeezing your ass cheek or<font color="#CCCCCC"> you're</font>

1387
00:55:20,509 --> 00:55:23,778
you're holding your belly in you're not

1388
00:55:22,309 --> 00:55:26,180
breathing it's all muscular attention

1389
00:55:23,778 --> 00:55:30,048
but you're doing<font color="#E5E5E5"> it so as you turn off</font>

1390
00:55:26,179 --> 00:55:32,028
<font color="#CCCCCC">your brain your body starts to relax so</font>

1391
00:55:30,048 --> 00:55:33,768
that's going from let's say that's the

1392
00:55:32,028 --> 00:55:35,960
dog and this is the tale you know which

1393
00:55:33,768 --> 00:55:38,179
what's happening to dog tag wagging the

1394
00:55:35,960 --> 00:55:41,090
tail to tail wagging the dog so it's

1395
00:55:38,179 --> 00:55:43,460
like<font color="#E5E5E5"> you move from this way down</font>

1396
00:55:41,090 --> 00:55:45,860
<font color="#CCCCCC">I found personally that it's far more</font>

1397
00:55:43,460 --> 00:55:48,139
arduous it takes a<font color="#E5E5E5"> long time it's just</font>

1398
00:55:45,860 --> 00:55:50,090
you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> I have a very hyper mind I</font>

1399
00:55:48,139 --> 00:55:51,529
<font color="#E5E5E5">think most people do so it's more</font>

1400
00:55:50,090 --> 00:55:56,809
difficult<font color="#E5E5E5"> for me to go from this way</font>

1401
00:55:51,530 --> 00:55:57,920
down so what I<font color="#E5E5E5"> also include and I think</font>

1402
00:55:56,809 --> 00:56:01,070
you really need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to do a little</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> bit of</font>

1403
00:55:57,920 --> 00:56:04,280
<font color="#E5E5E5">both is going from this way up and what</font>

1404
00:56:01,070 --> 00:56:07,280
I do is well bioenergetics is a form of

1405
00:56:04,280 --> 00:56:10,430
releasing muscular tension by allowing

1406
00:56:07,280 --> 00:56:13,460
the emotions that you're holding<font color="#CCCCCC"> back to</font>

1407
00:56:10,429 --> 00:56:15,469
come out and that looks<font color="#E5E5E5"> like just</font>

1408
00:56:13,460 --> 00:56:18,470
yelling screaming kicking throwing

1409
00:56:15,469 --> 00:56:19,789
temper tantrums saying gibberish or

1410
00:56:18,469 --> 00:56:21,079
whatever comes up in your your

1411
00:56:19,789 --> 00:56:23,329
consciousness I mean if you let yourself

1412
00:56:21,079 --> 00:56:25,610
just free associate with the words that

1413
00:56:23,329 --> 00:56:26,779
come up in your from you you'll say some

1414
00:56:25,610 --> 00:56:28,400
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the weirdest fucking shit and you're</font>

1415
00:56:26,780 --> 00:56:30,650
like I didn't even know I was thinking

1416
00:56:28,400 --> 00:56:32,420
<font color="#E5E5E5">that like where did that come from but</font>

1417
00:56:30,650 --> 00:56:34,460
you're literally holding it all in

1418
00:56:32,420 --> 00:56:37,159
you're holding all these emotions in and

1419
00:56:34,460 --> 00:56:39,260
the word holding is very indicative of

1420
00:56:37,159 --> 00:56:42,469
what happens we use a muscular system to

1421
00:56:39,260 --> 00:56:44,900
suppress or depress our hearts we

1422
00:56:42,469 --> 00:56:48,409
depress our sexuality we depress our

1423
00:56:44,900 --> 00:56:49,490
creativity we depress our emotion so

1424
00:56:48,409 --> 00:56:51,859
there's so much depression because we're

1425
00:56:49,489 --> 00:56:53,689
so busy depressing ourselves we're

1426
00:56:51,860 --> 00:56:56,090
compressing we're depressing or holding

1427
00:56:53,690 --> 00:56:58,070
it in and if you give yourself and<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font>

1428
00:56:56,090 --> 00:56:59,150
requires a lot of courage which in again

1429
00:56:58,070 --> 00:57:01,100
<font color="#E5E5E5">this is the second time we're talking</font>

1430
00:56:59,150 --> 00:57:02,809
about courage I think Courage's is the

1431
00:57:01,099 --> 00:57:06,139
iron quality in<font color="#E5E5E5"> this day and age</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

1432
00:57:02,809 --> 00:57:08,960
need courage now to grow if you<font color="#CCCCCC"> have</font>

1433
00:57:06,139 --> 00:57:12,400
enough courage to literally let go and

1434
00:57:08,960 --> 00:57:15,260
open your body up to in it to a full

1435
00:57:12,400 --> 00:57:18,769
experience of catharsis just let it all

1436
00:57:15,260 --> 00:57:23,000
that would exhaust yourself then what

1437
00:57:18,769 --> 00:57:25,219
happens is there is a relaxing of the

1438
00:57:23,000 --> 00:57:28,340
entire nervous system that accompanies

1439
00:57:25,219 --> 00:57:30,529
it your brain no longer has to hold you

1440
00:57:28,340 --> 00:57:31,789
<font color="#CCCCCC">don't have to you use your muscular</font>

1441
00:57:30,530 --> 00:57:33,650
system your nervous system and your

1442
00:57:31,789 --> 00:57:35,360
brain to hold<font color="#CCCCCC"> yourself back anymore</font>

1443
00:57:33,650 --> 00:57:37,610
because you've let it all out and

1444
00:57:35,360 --> 00:57:40,099
there's there's an immediate softening

1445
00:57:37,610 --> 00:57:42,260
of the respiratory wave let me spoke

1446
00:57:40,099 --> 00:57:44,000
about before right you soften your

1447
00:57:42,260 --> 00:57:45,440
respiratory wave guess what that tender

1448
00:57:44,000 --> 00:57:47,630
aggression comes back your sex life's

1449
00:57:45,440 --> 00:57:50,150
better you breathe deeper you feel

1450
00:57:47,630 --> 00:57:51,680
better when I have<font color="#E5E5E5"> I have every once in</font>

1451
00:57:50,150 --> 00:57:53,750
a while I<font color="#E5E5E5"> have</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> people come and you know</font>

1452
00:57:51,679 --> 00:57:55,579
they visit me for some sessions

1453
00:57:53,750 --> 00:57:57,800
oftentimes the very first thing<font color="#CCCCCC"> I do</font>

1454
00:57:55,579 --> 00:58:00,949
with them is bioenergetics and the

1455
00:57:57,800 --> 00:58:04,400
number one comment that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I receive after</font>

1456
00:58:00,949 --> 00:58:07,129
they're done is I feel like<font color="#E5E5E5"> somebody</font>

1457
00:58:04,400 --> 00:58:11,119
just washed my face with a cold wet

1458
00:58:07,130 --> 00:58:14,710
cough that and it feels like someone

1459
00:58:11,119 --> 00:58:19,309
just picked a big weight vest off of me

1460
00:58:14,710 --> 00:58:21,650
they feel soft and clean because you

1461
00:58:19,309 --> 00:58:24,590
literally<font color="#E5E5E5"> exercise that all the demons</font>

1462
00:58:21,650 --> 00:58:26,840
we're holding demons in there are demons

1463
00:58:24,590 --> 00:58:30,050
of anger<font color="#E5E5E5"> they're demons or frustrations</font>

1464
00:58:26,840 --> 00:58:31,190
sadness they're demons of joy you know

1465
00:58:30,050 --> 00:58:36,260
<font color="#E5E5E5">what's the last time last time you</font>

1466
00:58:31,190 --> 00:58:39,139
laughed deeply so I it this way that

1467
00:58:36,260 --> 00:58:43,100
meditation from the mine down is almost

1468
00:58:39,139 --> 00:58:44,989
like the Sun warming a block of ice if

1469
00:58:43,099 --> 00:58:48,309
we think of ourselves as tied up in a

1470
00:58:44,989 --> 00:58:53,389
block of ice the Sun is a<font color="#E5E5E5"> big warm</font>

1471
00:58:48,309 --> 00:58:55,759
energy that slowly melts the ice<font color="#CCCCCC"> we're</font>

1472
00:58:53,389 --> 00:58:58,639
bioenergetics is like taking a chisel

1473
00:58:55,760 --> 00:59:02,180
and a hammer and going like<font color="#CCCCCC"> that to the</font>

1474
00:58:58,639 --> 00:59:05,839
throat to the heart to the ball<font color="#E5E5E5"> breaking</font>

1484
00:59:34,340 --> 00:59:38,660
that it pulls out of<font color="#E5E5E5"> me i can only speak</font>

1485
00:59:36,530 --> 00:59:39,920
subjectively on this but the emotions

1486
00:59:38,659 --> 00:59:42,889
that have pulled out<font color="#E5E5E5"> of me just by</font>

1491
00:59:53,239 --> 00:59:57,799
do that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know it's the second time i</font>

1492
00:59:55,159 --> 00:59:59,839
made a catharsis video<font color="#E5E5E5"> the first time I</font>

1493
00:59:57,800 --> 01:00:02,750
never<font color="#E5E5E5"> really gave anybody any context</font>

1494
00:59:59,840 --> 01:00:05,180
for it and it got really misunderstood

1495
01:00:02,750 --> 01:00:06,860
so the second time it's funny I was<font color="#E5E5E5"> like</font>

1496
01:00:05,179 --> 01:00:07,009
okay we're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to we're going to put</font>

1497
01:00:06,860 --> 01:00:10,660
it

1498
01:00:07,010 --> 01:00:14,750
in context by adding some words<font color="#E5E5E5"> to it so</font>

1499
01:00:10,659 --> 01:00:19,129
the plan was to was for me to go into

1500
01:00:14,750 --> 01:00:21,320
what dr.<font color="#CCCCCC"> Glaser who's my mentor would</font>

1501
01:00:19,130 --> 01:00:22,640
call process work so you're about to go

1502
01:00:21,320 --> 01:00:24,500
into process work so you open up your

1503
01:00:22,639 --> 01:00:26,389
respiratory wave open up your breathing

1504
01:00:24,500 --> 01:00:28,940
<font color="#E5E5E5">and then you start moving and then</font>

1505
01:00:26,389 --> 01:00:30,409
<font color="#E5E5E5">whatever comes up comes up the plan was</font>

1506
01:00:28,940 --> 01:00:32,450
just to record<font color="#E5E5E5"> that and then I was going</font>

1507
01:00:30,409 --> 01:00:34,699
to write<font color="#CCCCCC"> something and then speak it</font>

1508
01:00:32,449 --> 01:00:36,710
over it but it's an amazing thing

1509
01:00:34,699 --> 01:00:38,539
happens when you free your body from

1510
01:00:36,710 --> 01:00:40,639
those demons or that much I call them

1511
01:00:38,539 --> 01:00:42,139
neurotic holding patterns when you free

1512
01:00:40,639 --> 01:00:45,259
your body from that muscular tension

1513
01:00:42,139 --> 01:00:48,799
that's done done to yourself all of a

1514
01:00:45,260 --> 01:00:50,210
sudden<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's almost like and this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is of</font>

1515
01:00:48,800 --> 01:00:52,010
<font color="#E5E5E5">course words are going to screw this up</font>

1516
01:00:50,210 --> 01:00:55,220
it's almost<font color="#E5E5E5"> like you get out the way and</font>

1517
01:00:52,010 --> 01:00:57,470
God starts talking through you because

1518
01:00:55,219 --> 01:00:59,869
you're not<font color="#E5E5E5"> there anymore your ego is</font>

1519
01:00:57,469 --> 01:01:02,179
almost gone you've exhausted your ego

1520
01:00:59,869 --> 01:01:05,630
and you become an open vessel almost

1521
01:01:02,179 --> 01:01:07,489
like a flute now that's hollow hollow

1522
01:01:05,630 --> 01:01:08,900
Reed I think it's describing some

1523
01:01:07,489 --> 01:01:12,649
spiritual<font color="#CCCCCC"> texts you become a hollow Reed</font>

1524
01:01:08,900 --> 01:01:14,840
and I literally SAT up from after doing

1525
01:01:12,650 --> 01:01:17,030
the process work i<font color="#E5E5E5"> SAT</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> up and the words</font>

1526
01:01:14,840 --> 01:01:19,220
just<font color="#CCCCCC"> flowed out of me so what you're</font>

1527
01:01:17,030 --> 01:01:20,600
hearing on that video because you might

1528
01:01:19,219 --> 01:01:22,609
notice that<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's very</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> difficult to hear</font>

1529
01:01:20,599 --> 01:01:24,920
it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> because the air conditioner was on</font>

1530
01:01:22,610 --> 01:01:27,110
and the audio wasn't set up<font color="#E5E5E5"> because I</font>

1531
01:01:24,920 --> 01:01:28,880
<font color="#E5E5E5">wasn't supposed to speak but i SAT</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> up</font>

1532
01:01:27,110 --> 01:01:30,950
and I<font color="#CCCCCC"> just started talking and those</font>

1533
01:01:28,880 --> 01:01:33,890
were<font color="#E5E5E5"> the words that had to be said and</font>

1534
01:01:30,949 --> 01:01:35,419
we tried our best we're like man how<font color="#CCCCCC"> can</font>

1535
01:01:33,889 --> 01:01:38,119
you get it so that doesn't sound so

1536
01:01:35,420 --> 01:01:41,539
muffled because we didn't plan on you

1537
01:01:38,119 --> 01:01:42,469
saying these things and luckily we you

1538
01:01:41,539 --> 01:01:44,719
know we're able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to pieces together</font>

1539
01:01:42,469 --> 01:01:46,429
