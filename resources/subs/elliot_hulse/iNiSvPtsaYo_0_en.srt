on to what am I and if somebody says you

48
00:02:13,270 --> 00:02:17,680
in a big head you will quickly have an

49
00:02:15,819 --> 00:02:25,239

videos so I've subject myself to the

53
00:02:30,129 --> 00:02:35,590
world or criticism to this<font color="#E5E5E5"> day if I</font>

54
00:02:33,490 --> 00:02:37,780
really comment sometimes that's like

63
00:03:07,509 --> 00:03:14,109
myself your best bet number one it is

64
00:03:11,409 --> 00:03:16,299
possible is to stay away<font color="#CCCCCC"> from criticism</font>

65
00:03:14,110 --> 00:03:18,519
<font color="#E5E5E5">just stay with someone who you know is</font>

66
00:03:16,300 --> 00:03:21,670
going to put you down I hope I just

74
00:03:40,180 --> 00:03:46,180
this that gets me be very aware of what

75
00:03:44,019 --> 00:03:48,968
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> is so that when you see it coming</font>
