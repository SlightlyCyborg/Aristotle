this very thing yeah we've been<font color="#E5E5E5"> lied to</font>

147
00:05:43,750 --> 00:05:47,500
about what we're supposed to do because

148
00:05:45,189 --> 00:05:50,339
<font color="#CCCCCC">a real gift to ourselves into the world</font>

149
00:05:47,500 --> 00:05:52,300
is<font color="#CCCCCC"> to do what our heart wants us to do</font>

152
00:05:56,110 --> 00:06:01,030
from your heart my father was a really

153

world and it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> like you got</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to put stuff</font>

just how it is right and we kind of lose

177
00:06:52,209 --> 00:06:55,329
what we really want we kind of think of

178
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:58,330
<font color="#E5E5E5">the same</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> thing but they're really</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> not</font>

180
00:06:58,329 --> 00:07:03,519
been told and then manipulated to do

181
00:07:01,060 --> 00:07:06,759
based on the most<font color="#E5E5E5"> insidious form of</font>

182
00:07:03,519 --> 00:07:09,069
slavery which is fear fear and then

183
00:07:06,759 --> 00:07:11,918
guilt which<font color="#CCCCCC"> is an offshoot of fear but</font>

184
00:07:09,069 --> 00:07:12,519
it's a very closely tied one so you do

185
00:07:11,918 --> 00:07:14,439
what you're supposed to do because

186
00:07:12,519 --> 00:07:15,939
you're afraid of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the boogey man the</font>

fear fear fear fear fear fear or<font color="#E5E5E5"> honor</font>

196
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:40,389
to those who<font color="#E5E5E5"> have served you guilt well</font>

197
00:07:38,019 --> 00:07:43,000
my parents did this for me they did that

<font color="#CCCCCC">for me</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> like dad wants me to so guilt</font>

199
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:47,649
those are all manifestations of the ego

200
00:07:45,550 --> 00:07:49,840
because there's no fear or guilt in the

201
00:07:47,649 --> 00:07:54,609
heart the heart is love it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> pure</font>

202
00:07:49,839 --> 00:07:57,429
pureness it's a sad thing when we've

203
00:07:54,610 --> 00:08:00,520
what we've<font color="#E5E5E5"> created a magnificent society</font>

204
00:07:57,430 --> 00:08:02,740
<font color="#E5E5E5">I suppose it's all relative but it's a</font>

205
00:08:00,519 --> 00:08:04,990
horrible thing when the individual units

206
00:08:02,740 --> 00:08:07,329
of that society are poisoned by the

207
00:08:04,990 --> 00:08:09,519
fears that keep them shackled to a

208
00:08:07,329 --> 00:08:10,509
system as if they're slaves and it's

209
00:08:09,519 --> 00:08:12,490
like if we could break out of that

210
00:08:10,509 --> 00:08:15,279
fucking fear life will be beautiful<font color="#E5E5E5"> even</font>

211
00:08:12,490 --> 00:08:18,639
if you just<font color="#E5E5E5"> have a little bit you don't</font>

212
00:08:15,279 --> 00:08:21,259
need much<font color="#E5E5E5"> you want to blend these things</font>

213
00:08:18,639 --> 00:08:24,050
together it's funny right like if we

214
00:08:21,259 --> 00:08:25,759
thunderheart right we<font color="#CCCCCC"> can</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> totally tie</font>

215
00:08:24,050 --> 00:08:28,610
that into our physical being everyone's

216
00:08:25,759 --> 00:08:32,509
hunched over right arm hardest hit me

217
00:08:28,610 --> 00:08:34,490
right it's it might be coincidence<font color="#CCCCCC"> but</font>

218
00:08:32,509 --> 00:08:38,029
at the same time it's still there right

219
00:08:34,490 --> 00:08:41,299
we can see<font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I mean if you study the</font>

220
00:08:38,029 --> 00:08:43,339
ancient forms of meditation and exercise

221
00:08:41,299 --> 00:08:45,049
which were blended meditation and

222

four parts of<font color="#E5E5E5"> your body that have</font>

232
00:09:09,730 --> 00:09:16,850
emotionally it shows up physically in

233
00:09:13,610 --> 00:09:18,980
your body if you<font color="#CCCCCC"> need concrete evidence</font>

234
00:09:16,850 --> 00:09:20,240
or if you have<font color="#E5E5E5"> the slightest bit of</font>

235
00:09:18,980 --> 00:09:23,509
imagination to put two and two together

236
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:26,330
and get fucking for just look at the

237
00:09:23,509 --> 00:09:31,009
brain it's literally literally looks

238
00:09:26,330 --> 00:09:33,680
<font color="#CCCCCC">like a flower tied to its stem the</font>

239
00:09:31,009 --> 00:09:36,350
spinal cord that roots itself in the

240
00:09:33,679 --> 00:09:38,959
<font color="#CCCCCC">soil of the body</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> just look at the</font>

241
00:09:36,350 --> 00:09:42,470
<font color="#E5E5E5">nervous human nervous system the soil</font>

242
00:09:38,960 --> 00:09:46,040
through which the flowering of the mind

243
00:09:42,470 --> 00:09:49,850
is created is in our body so if the body

244
00:09:46,039 --> 00:09:52,969
is if you've got poor soil what kind of

245
00:09:49,850 --> 00:09:55,310
fruit you're going to have and vice

246
00:09:52,970 --> 00:09:58,490
versa so the<font color="#E5E5E5"> body has to be well cared</font>

247
00:09:55,309 --> 00:10:01,729
for and that means stretching that means

248
00:09:58,490 --> 00:10:03,379
exercising their music breathing<font color="#CCCCCC"> deeply</font>

249
00:10:01,730 --> 00:10:05,240
all right talk about breathing into your

250
00:10:03,379 --> 00:10:06,710
balls you understand that right it means

251
00:10:05,240 --> 00:10:09,080
having a soft enough muscular system

252
00:10:06,710 --> 00:10:11,000
that you literally massage your organs

253
00:10:09,080 --> 00:10:13,639
way down<font color="#E5E5E5"> into your pelvic floor each</font>

254
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:16,129
breath that you take difficult to walk

255
00:10:13,639 --> 00:10:17,960
around that way but you can practice

256
00:10:16,129 --> 00:10:20,450
through the exercises IT

257
00:10:17,960 --> 00:10:22,280
through yoga breathing through chi-gong

258
00:10:20,450 --> 00:10:24,950
breathing this is where we have to<font color="#CCCCCC"> go</font>

259
00:10:22,279 --> 00:10:27,740
back<font color="#E5E5E5"> with regard to exercise not lifting</font>

260
00:10:24,950 --> 00:10:30,230
I love lifting but but we don't need any

261
00:10:27,740 --> 00:10:33,110
<font color="#CCCCCC">more meatheads we need more people with</font>

262
00:10:30,230 --> 00:10:35,350
sensitive strong bodies that are<font color="#E5E5E5"> able to</font>

263
00:10:33,110 --> 00:10:38,149
carry them through life in a creative

264
00:10:35,350 --> 00:10:40,420
grounded fashion that what's<font color="#E5E5E5"> really</font>

265
00:10:38,149 --> 00:10:40,419
missing
