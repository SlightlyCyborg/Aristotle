1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,259
so our buddy John here is 20 years old

2
00:00:02,669 --> 00:00:10,950
and he only can see himself falling in

3
00:00:07,259 --> 00:00:12,539
love with<font color="#E5E5E5"> in being with a virgin so a</font>

4
00:00:10,949 --> 00:00:15,178
woman that hasn't had sex with another

5
00:00:12,539 --> 00:00:16,500
man he talks to a lot of girls and they

6
00:00:15,179 --> 00:00:18,089
get to know<font color="#E5E5E5"> each other but the minute he</font>

7
00:00:16,500 --> 00:00:20,850
finds out<font color="#E5E5E5"> that she's had sex with</font>

8
00:00:18,089 --> 00:00:22,140
someone else<font color="#E5E5E5"> not during</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the relationship</font>

9
00:00:20,850 --> 00:00:24,750
but as they're getting to know each

10
00:00:22,140 --> 00:00:27,990
other he finds out<font color="#E5E5E5"> that oh so you've had</font>

11
00:00:24,750 --> 00:00:31,890
sex before her value in his eyes

12
00:00:27,989 --> 00:00:33,780
immediately drops right and this it

13
00:00:31,890 --> 00:00:35,880
irritates him in and he understands that

14
00:00:33,780 --> 00:00:38,549
this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is probably</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> not very practical to</font>

15
00:00:35,880 --> 00:00:39,989
think and behave in this way because the

16
00:00:38,549 --> 00:00:41,429
majority of the girls<font color="#E5E5E5"> that he's</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> talking</font>

17
00:00:39,988 --> 00:00:43,439
to and probably who he's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to come</font>

18
00:00:41,429 --> 00:00:45,058
in contact<font color="#E5E5E5"> with are going to have had</font>

19
00:00:43,439 --> 00:00:46,378
sex already it's just you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it's a</font>

20
00:00:45,058 --> 00:00:49,530
part of the culture it's it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> the way we</font>

21
00:00:46,378 --> 00:00:51,539
do things right we women we all become

22
00:00:49,530 --> 00:00:54,448
very sexual at a very young age 14 years

23
00:00:51,539 --> 00:00:58,140
old so so to expect someone to go into

24
00:00:54,448 --> 00:01:00,390
sexual ripeness the age of 14 and then

25
00:00:58,140 --> 00:01:02,579
move all the way through their 20s

26
00:01:00,390 --> 00:01:03,359
without having sexs is rare it's just

27
00:01:02,579 --> 00:01:06,239
something<font color="#CCCCCC"> that's not</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> going to happen</font>

28
00:01:03,359 --> 00:01:08,609
<font color="#E5E5E5">that easily or very often so what can</font>

29
00:01:06,239 --> 00:01:11,188
<font color="#E5E5E5">you do to get over this right you make</font>

30
00:01:08,609 --> 00:01:12,989
another very interesting point in your

31
00:01:11,188 --> 00:01:15,629
question you say that the other thing

32
00:01:12,989 --> 00:01:18,089
<font color="#E5E5E5">that I that really has to be there for</font>

33
00:01:15,629 --> 00:01:20,039
<font color="#CCCCCC">me is that I need</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to be able to speak</font>

34
00:01:18,090 --> 00:01:22,950
<font color="#CCCCCC">with this woman on an intimate level</font>

35
00:01:20,040 --> 00:01:25,710
very personally unless we<font color="#E5E5E5"> can share very</font>

36
00:01:22,950 --> 00:01:28,379
personal intimate conversation I lose

37
00:01:25,709 --> 00:01:31,949
interest you're an interesting<font color="#E5E5E5"> dude it</font>

38
00:01:28,379 --> 00:01:33,089
and I I feel a sense of connection<font color="#E5E5E5"> with</font>

39
00:01:31,950 --> 00:01:38,219
you because a lot of the things you're

40
00:01:33,090 --> 00:01:40,020
<font color="#CCCCCC">saying I feel also the thing with what a</font>

41
00:01:38,219 --> 00:01:41,489
red light red flag<font color="#CCCCCC"> that goes off for me</font>

42
00:01:40,019 --> 00:01:43,950
when you say<font color="#CCCCCC"> that you can talk to women</font>

43
00:01:41,489 --> 00:01:45,539
or you need to have a verbal

44
00:01:43,950 --> 00:01:46,530
communication relationship with them

45
00:01:45,540 --> 00:01:51,118
you've got to be able to<font color="#E5E5E5"> express</font>

46
00:01:46,530 --> 00:01:55,439
ourselves through talk means to me that

47
00:01:51,118 --> 00:01:58,500
you're looking<font color="#CCCCCC"> for a life partner you're</font>

48
00:01:55,438 --> 00:02:00,729
looking for someone<font color="#CCCCCC"> who</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is on the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> same</font>

49
00:01:58,500 --> 00:02:02,379
energetic wavelength as

50
00:02:00,730 --> 00:02:03,700
you're not just<font color="#CCCCCC"> looking at obviously</font>

51
00:02:02,379 --> 00:02:04,899
<font color="#CCCCCC">you're not looking to just go and have</font>

52
00:02:03,700 --> 00:02:06,850
sex and you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> not looking for somebody</font>

53
00:02:04,900 --> 00:02:08,170
to fill your ego gratification you're

54
00:02:06,849 --> 00:02:12,159
looking for someone<font color="#E5E5E5"> who you can share</font>

00:02:13,599 --> 00:02:18,639
your heart with who hasn't shared their

58
00:02:15,099 --> 00:02:19,960
sexual energy with right so you<font color="#CCCCCC"> want to</font>

with also this is very pure right and it

63
00:02:27,009 --> 00:02:32,530
may seem narcissistic and crazy for you

64
00:02:29,469 --> 00:02:33,699
<font color="#E5E5E5">to think I just want a virgin you're not</font>

willing to<font color="#E5E5E5"> open your heart and you want</font>

70
00:02:43,539 --> 00:02:48,969
to share<font color="#CCCCCC"> that openly with someone who</font>

71
00:02:45,550 --> 00:02:52,240
has not done so with someone else you

72
00:02:48,969 --> 00:02:54,550
want your<font color="#CCCCCC"> own and it's this selfishness</font>

73
00:02:52,240 --> 00:02:56,500
that's that's causing<font color="#CCCCCC"> you this problem</font>

74
00:02:54,550 --> 00:02:58,480
it's thinking that when you share that

75
00:02:56,500 --> 00:03:01,349
that heart and sexual energy with

76
00:02:58,479 --> 00:03:07,179
another person that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you own each other</font>

77
00:03:01,349 --> 00:03:10,329
what you got to realize is that everyone

78
00:03:07,180 --> 00:03:13,180
is on their own journey regardless of

79
00:03:10,330 --> 00:03:14,770
<font color="#E5E5E5">how much or who they love that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> woman</font>
