hey I'm making<font color="#CCCCCC"> this video as a part two</font>

2
00:00:02,250 --> 00:00:05,849
to the my<font color="#CCCCCC"> girlfriends orgasm face video</font>

3
00:00:04,500 --> 00:00:08,068
that you probably just watched maybe

00:00:05,849 --> 00:00:11,580
<font color="#CCCCCC">yesterday as i finish that video</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> i</font>

5
00:00:08,069 --> 00:00:14,429
wanted to further elaborate on what it

6
00:00:11,580 --> 00:00:17,039
means<font color="#CCCCCC"> to recognize negative thoughts and</font>

7
00:00:14,429 --> 00:00:19,320
when they're attacking you and how to

8
00:00:17,039 --> 00:00:21,150
turn away from them one of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> things</font>

9
00:00:19,320 --> 00:00:24,990
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> i fail to mention in that video is</font>

10
00:00:21,149 --> 00:00:26,879
that you will know if automatic negative

11
00:00:24,989 --> 00:00:30,028
thoughts like watching your girlfriend

12
00:00:26,879 --> 00:00:31,768
getting boned in your head watching are

13
00:00:30,028 --> 00:00:34,380
getting boned by another dude is

14
00:00:31,768 --> 00:00:35,519
happening or if it to know if it's

15
00:00:34,380 --> 00:00:36,630
affecting you because you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to</font>

16
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:38,609
feel it in your body you're going to

17
00:00:36,630 --> 00:00:40,260
feel it in your physiology you will know

18
00:00:38,609 --> 00:00:42,988
immediately that you are<font color="#E5E5E5"> being affected</font>

19
00:00:40,259 --> 00:00:45,899
<font color="#CCCCCC">netic negatively by a thought by how you</font>

20
00:00:42,988 --> 00:00:48,570
breathe<font color="#CCCCCC"> i want you to recognize this so</font>

21
00:00:45,899 --> 00:00:51,030
although it is the abstract thought is

22
00:00:48,570 --> 00:00:53,100
coming<font color="#E5E5E5"> and you turn away from it it's</font>

23
00:00:51,030 --> 00:00:55,198
<font color="#E5E5E5">very difficult sometimes to know if you</font>

24
00:00:53,100 --> 00:00:56,370
are<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually entertaining it or not you</font>

25
00:00:55,198 --> 00:00:58,679
know because a lot of times what we

26
00:00:56,369 --> 00:01:01,250
resist persists so it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> the fact that</font>

27
00:00:58,679 --> 00:01:04,260
you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> trying to push the thought away</font>

28
00:01:01,250 --> 00:01:07,618
you're actually engaging with the

29
00:01:04,260 --> 00:01:08,969
thought right<font color="#E5E5E5"> to really cut off means</font>

30
00:01:07,618 --> 00:01:11,368
that you<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't feel it in your</font>

31
00:01:08,969 --> 00:01:13,140
physiology when that idea when that

32
00:01:11,368 --> 00:01:14,790
negative thought no matter what<font color="#CCCCCC"> it is</font>

33
00:01:13,140 --> 00:01:17,368
because we<font color="#CCCCCC"> have them you know the orgasm</font>

34
00:01:14,790 --> 00:01:19,710
face one is just one example but we<font color="#E5E5E5"> have</font>

35
00:01:17,368 --> 00:01:21,840
them in<font color="#E5E5E5"> all types of you know all areas</font>

36
00:01:19,709 --> 00:01:23,548
of our lives you know I remember<font color="#E5E5E5"> dealing</font>

37
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:26,728
with<font color="#E5E5E5"> this big time when i first</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> started</font>

00:01:23,549 --> 00:01:29,490
my business and I just the idea that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

39
00:01:26,728 --> 00:01:31,500
will always be broke was it would come

40

into<font color="#E5E5E5"> my</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> mind that my family would fall</font>

00:01:31,500 --> 00:01:34,978
apart my wife would leave me<font color="#CCCCCC"> because I</font>

life these automatic negative thoughts

48
00:01:44,969 --> 00:01:48,179
some people would say that it's like

49
00:01:46,530 --> 00:01:52,560
demons or like the devil is talking to

50
00:01:48,180 --> 00:01:54,270
<font color="#E5E5E5">you come you will know that you're free</font>

00:01:54,269 --> 00:02:01,048
from the<font color="#E5E5E5"> negative visualization when you</font>

are breathing softly when you are<font color="#E5E5E5"> not</font>

54
00:02:01,049 --> 00:02:05,159
affected physiologically when your<font color="#E5E5E5"> belly</font>

55
00:02:03,180 --> 00:02:08,069
is relaxed when your chest is relaxed

when your jaw and face is relaxed you

57
00:02:08,068 --> 00:02:12,269
<font color="#CCCCCC">know I I didn't bring it up because I</font>

66
00:02:27,180 --> 00:02:30,510
know that it's happening because you

67
00:02:28,709 --> 00:02:33,330
<font color="#E5E5E5">will feel it in your body I'd like you</font>

wrestle with them right don't analyze

them don't try to give your try to fight

them with rationalization ignore them

<font color="#E5E5E5">completely and you know that's happening</font>

people when I say things like you know

83
00:03:11,848 --> 00:03:16,889
don't entertain negative thoughts people

84
00:03:13,949 --> 00:03:18,780
then decide to rationalize themselves

85
00:03:16,889 --> 00:03:20,548
out of the negative thought the<font color="#E5E5E5"> problem</font>

86
00:03:18,780 --> 00:03:22,979
is that<font color="#E5E5E5"> the conscious mind the ego right</font>

87
00:03:20,549 --> 00:03:24,689
the ego is creating the negative thought

88
00:03:22,979 --> 00:03:26,518
and then you're also trying to<font color="#E5E5E5"> use</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

89
00:03:24,689 --> 00:03:28,439

can't I signed I think<font color="#CCCCCC"> said once that</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">from which it it's created you can't</font>

93
00:03:34,049 --> 00:03:39,260
solve a problem from the place<font color="#CCCCCC"> that it</font>

00:03:36,120 --> 00:03:41,549
was<font color="#E5E5E5"> created right with the same</font>

technique that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> causing you problems is</font>

97
00:03:45,030 --> 00:03:49,650
your mind creating automatic negative

thoughts for you to wrestle with<font color="#E5E5E5"> it on</font>

feels good good luck
