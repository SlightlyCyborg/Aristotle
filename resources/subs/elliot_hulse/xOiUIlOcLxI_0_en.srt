1
00:00:00,740 --> 00:00:04,469
hey before<font color="#E5E5E5"> I start ranting on this video</font>

2
00:00:03,388 --> 00:00:07,230
the very first thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> I want to do is</font>

3
00:00:04,469 --> 00:00:09,089
extend some gratitude and say thank you

4
00:00:07,230 --> 00:00:10,530
to those you who have recognized that

5
00:00:09,089 --> 00:00:12,058
the elliott hulse that you've seen<font color="#E5E5E5"> on</font>

6
00:00:10,529 --> 00:00:15,509
camera for the past several days and in

7
00:00:12,058 --> 00:00:16,829
fact every video recorded this week is

8
00:00:15,509 --> 00:00:18,480
not the elliott hulse that you're used

9
00:00:16,829 --> 00:00:20,070
to in fact it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> not the elliott hulse</font>

10
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:26,099
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> i have come</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to know over the past</font>

11
00:00:20,070 --> 00:00:27,390
several years either so again the main

12
00:00:26,099 --> 00:00:29,579
reason why<font color="#E5E5E5"> I want to make this video is</font>

13
00:00:27,390 --> 00:00:32,070
because<font color="#E5E5E5"> I I am grateful of the fact that</font>

14
00:00:29,579 --> 00:00:33,929
I have so<font color="#E5E5E5"> many people that are concerned</font>

15
00:00:32,070 --> 00:00:36,058
about<font color="#E5E5E5"> me now we might not know each</font>

16
00:00:33,929 --> 00:00:37,530
other and we just<font color="#CCCCCC"> exchanged bits through</font>

17
00:00:36,058 --> 00:00:40,019
the internet you know the cloud in the

18
00:00:37,530 --> 00:00:43,980
sky you<font color="#CCCCCC"> guys write comments and I make</font>

19
00:00:40,020 --> 00:00:46,140
these videos but<font color="#E5E5E5"> two for me to recognize</font>

20
00:00:43,979 --> 00:00:48,209
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you see how different I've been</font>

21
00:00:46,140 --> 00:00:50,070
just sheds light on the fact that how

22
00:00:48,210 --> 00:00:52,500
close we actually are<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know I know</font>

23
00:00:50,070 --> 00:00:54,628
many of you know a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> about me and you</font>

24
00:00:52,500 --> 00:00:56,219
watch me every single day and you can

25
00:00:54,628 --> 00:00:59,909
tell when the look and<font color="#E5E5E5"> Elliott's eyes</font>

26
00:00:56,219 --> 00:01:02,070
isn't what it usually is and<font color="#CCCCCC"> I tried</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

27
00:00:59,909 --> 00:01:04,349
deny it I tried to<font color="#CCCCCC"> talk circles around</font>

28
00:01:02,070 --> 00:01:06,269
it I try to as<font color="#CCCCCC"> Elliot house often does</font>

29
00:01:04,349 --> 00:01:09,509
philosophize about it but here's the

30
00:01:06,269 --> 00:01:12,118
thing it's true I<font color="#CCCCCC"> am NOT myself</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I am not</font>

31
00:01:09,510 --> 00:01:14,609
feeling myself and I just got out of the

32
00:01:12,118 --> 00:01:16,170
office with a really good friend and

33
00:01:14,609 --> 00:01:20,459
mentor of mine and we spoke for two

34
00:01:16,170 --> 00:01:21,810
hours on what this what's going on<font color="#E5E5E5"> there</font>

35
00:01:20,459 --> 00:01:24,269
are a few different ways<font color="#CCCCCC"> to approach</font>

36
00:01:21,810 --> 00:01:26,759
this number one is this it's merely

37
00:01:24,269 --> 00:01:28,679
evolution human beings evolved but<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm</font>

38
00:01:26,759 --> 00:01:31,140
hitting a rough patch so it's not just

39
00:01:28,680 --> 00:01:32,490
smooth evolution you know because I

40
00:01:31,140 --> 00:01:33,629
there's a lot of anxiety there's a lot

41
00:01:32,489 --> 00:01:36,959
of frustration there's a lot of

42
00:01:33,629 --> 00:01:38,938
confusion in me I'm tired I'm burnt out

43
00:01:36,959 --> 00:01:42,688
and you could see that in my eyes and

44
00:01:38,938 --> 00:01:45,059
<font color="#E5E5E5">you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know this so what's really</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> happening</font>

45
00:01:42,688 --> 00:01:48,148
and the conclusion that we came to is

46
00:01:45,060 --> 00:01:49,799
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I've made some poor decisions over</font>

47
00:01:48,149 --> 00:01:51,868
the past several months about my

48
00:01:49,799 --> 00:01:55,170
nutrition lifestyle and even my training

49
00:01:51,868 --> 00:01:59,099
that has without<font color="#E5E5E5"> getting too much into</font>

50
00:01:55,170 --> 00:02:03,899
the training aspects and died<font color="#E5E5E5"> and the</font>

51
00:01:59,099 --> 00:02:06,658
philosophy there with<font color="#E5E5E5"> within it has just</font>

52
00:02:03,899 --> 00:02:09,090
become a situation<font color="#E5E5E5"> where my body has</font>

53
00:02:06,659 --> 00:02:11,250
become<font color="#E5E5E5"> too much for my soul to carry</font>

54
00:02:09,090 --> 00:02:12,810
it's too heavy I've gained too much

55
00:02:11,250 --> 00:02:14,280
fucking wait

56
00:02:12,810 --> 00:02:16,409
I mean there's no other way to put it

57
00:02:14,280 --> 00:02:18,539
I've gained so much weight that my body

58
00:02:16,409 --> 00:02:20,340
might the soul can't express itself

59
00:02:18,539 --> 00:02:22,259
through me the way it<font color="#CCCCCC"> should now it's</font>

60
00:02:20,340 --> 00:02:24,030
it's not just the body weight but it's

61
00:02:22,259 --> 00:02:25,679
also the pollution associated with

62
00:02:24,030 --> 00:02:27,568
eating foods that are wrong<font color="#E5E5E5"> for my</font>

63
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:30,510
metabolic type I know better<font color="#E5E5E5"> than to</font>

64
00:02:27,568 --> 00:02:32,488
start<font color="#E5E5E5"> eating diets participating in</font>

65
00:02:30,509 --> 00:02:34,500
diets that are more of a<font color="#CCCCCC"> bodybuilding</font>

66
00:02:32,489 --> 00:02:36,509
type diet they just don't work for me

67
00:02:34,500 --> 00:02:38,068
I'm sure they work well for other people

68
00:02:36,509 --> 00:02:40,709
but there's a particular diet that works

69
00:02:38,068 --> 00:02:42,719
well for my metabolic type that my

70
00:02:40,709 --> 00:02:45,120
body's used to that allows my brain to

71
00:02:42,719 --> 00:02:46,799
be as quick as it should be well as my

72
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:48,989
nervous system to be as sharp as it

73
00:02:46,799 --> 00:02:52,260
should be and allows Elliot Hills to

74
00:02:48,989 --> 00:02:54,120
express himself and its fullest<font color="#E5E5E5"> and then</font>

75
00:02:52,259 --> 00:02:57,479
there are diets that fuck<font color="#E5E5E5"> that all up</font>

76
00:02:54,120 --> 00:02:58,650
and I've been<font color="#E5E5E5"> eating diet I know better</font>

77
00:02:57,479 --> 00:03:01,949
you know sometimes<font color="#E5E5E5"> we make decisions</font>

78
00:02:58,650 --> 00:03:03,750
that uh it's almost like I want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to try</font>

79
00:03:01,949 --> 00:03:05,339
it<font color="#E5E5E5"> out wanna see you know even though</font>

80
00:03:03,750 --> 00:03:06,719
you know the answer sometimes you know

81
00:03:05,340 --> 00:03:08,969
what's going to happen you still do<font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font>

82
00:03:06,719 --> 00:03:11,068
and I did it and and the same<font color="#CCCCCC"> thing goes</font>

83
00:03:08,969 --> 00:03:12,509
<font color="#CCCCCC">with the training</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you know hypertrophy</font>

84
00:03:11,068 --> 00:03:14,639
type training does not work well with me

85
00:03:12,509 --> 00:03:15,929
because it restricts my motility and

86
00:03:14,639 --> 00:03:16,919
I've used that word before and a lot of

87
00:03:15,930 --> 00:03:19,920
<font color="#CCCCCC">people don't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> know what it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> means but it</font>

88
00:03:16,919 --> 00:03:22,979
it's how soft the muscular system is in

89
00:03:19,919 --> 00:03:24,839
order to allow full energetic or

90
00:03:22,979 --> 00:03:26,789
emotional expression and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm an</font>

91
00:03:24,840 --> 00:03:30,739
emotional fucking guy<font color="#E5E5E5"> figure it out and</font>

92
00:03:26,789 --> 00:03:34,078
what makes my ability<font color="#E5E5E5"> to express myself</font>

93
00:03:30,739 --> 00:03:35,640
verbally through these videos verbally

94
00:03:34,079 --> 00:03:37,230
and physically because I move a lot if

95
00:03:35,639 --> 00:03:39,449
you haven't figured it out my face and

96
00:03:37,229 --> 00:03:41,250
<font color="#CCCCCC">body</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is always fucking moving is the</font>

97
00:03:39,449 --> 00:03:43,979
<font color="#E5E5E5">softness in my muscular system my</font>

98
00:03:41,250 --> 00:03:47,009
ability<font color="#CCCCCC"> to breathe deep bodybuilding</font>

99
00:03:43,979 --> 00:03:48,869
training doesn't allow that so those

100
00:03:47,009 --> 00:03:51,149
<font color="#E5E5E5">things coupled with just the you know</font>

101
00:03:48,870 --> 00:03:53,030
the tremendous change in my life due<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

102
00:03:51,150 --> 00:03:56,969
the popularity of these freaking videos

103
00:03:53,030 --> 00:04:03,620
has just been a a whirlwind it's a

104
00:03:56,969 --> 00:04:06,060
perfect storm for for the<font color="#E5E5E5"> depths of I</font>

105
00:04:03,620 --> 00:04:09,870
guess you<font color="#CCCCCC"> could say depression that I've</font>

106
00:04:06,060 --> 00:04:10,769
put myself into so I could assure you

107
00:04:09,870 --> 00:04:13,379
that everything will<font color="#E5E5E5"> be just fine</font>

108
00:04:10,769 --> 00:04:16,228
because I figured<font color="#CCCCCC"> it out and you know I</font>

109
00:04:13,379 --> 00:04:18,988
my soul figured it out I understood this

110
00:04:16,228 --> 00:04:21,269
I felt this I knew I was going against

111
00:04:18,988 --> 00:04:25,259
what my body actually wanted when I went

112
00:04:21,269 --> 00:04:26,430
down this road but I'm back on my diet

113
00:04:25,259 --> 00:04:29,788
which<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

114
00:04:26,430 --> 00:04:32,250
a paleo like intermittent fasting which

115
00:04:29,788 --> 00:04:33,930
I'm coming to discover is not just great

116
00:04:32,250 --> 00:04:35,610
for health you know their health

117
00:04:33,930 --> 00:04:39,538
benefits but psychological benefits

118
00:04:35,610 --> 00:04:42,060
associated with restricting the the

119
00:04:39,538 --> 00:04:45,209
<font color="#CCCCCC">quote-unquote hunger impulse within the</font>

120
00:04:42,060 --> 00:04:49,288
body you it's almost where you allow the

121
00:04:45,209 --> 00:04:51,359
greater you to control the<font color="#CCCCCC"> lower you or</font>

122
00:04:49,288 --> 00:04:53,279
me<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know fuck I don't wanna talk for</font>

123
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:57,870
everybody but I know that<font color="#CCCCCC"> when I can use</font>

124
00:04:53,279 --> 00:04:59,519
my mind to come my body that I am in a

125
00:04:57,870 --> 00:05:01,560
stronger place and intermittent fasting

126
00:04:59,519 --> 00:05:04,228
allows me to do that back<font color="#E5E5E5"> on</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> road to</font>

127
00:05:01,560 --> 00:05:06,180
that back to athletic training you've

128
00:05:04,228 --> 00:05:07,139
seen me doing Olympic lifting it's great

129
00:05:06,180 --> 00:05:08,668
because there's a challenge<font color="#CCCCCC"> for me</font>

130
00:05:07,139 --> 00:05:11,699
Olympic lifting is brand new to me in

131
00:05:08,668 --> 00:05:15,629
many ways and and it's athletic it's not

132
00:05:11,699 --> 00:05:18,259
<font color="#E5E5E5">it's</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> not narcissistic like bodybuilding</font>

133
00:05:15,629 --> 00:05:20,370
and I was actually becoming narcissistic

134
00:05:18,259 --> 00:05:23,879
through the bodybuilding not just

135
00:05:20,370 --> 00:05:25,680
physically but psychologically so that's

136
00:05:23,879 --> 00:05:27,959
it again the main purpose of this video

137
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:32,668
is to extend<font color="#E5E5E5"> my gratitude say thank you</font>

138
00:05:27,959 --> 00:05:36,658
for your concern your care and dare I

139
00:05:32,668 --> 00:05:39,689
say love for Elliott Hulse and to let

140
00:05:36,658 --> 00:05:40,740
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that yes we are</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> in relationship</font>

141
00:05:39,689 --> 00:05:43,740
<font color="#E5E5E5">with each other even though it was just</font>

142
00:05:40,740 --> 00:05:47,009
<font color="#E5E5E5">bits on a screen and I love you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> as well</font>

143
00:05:43,740 --> 00:05:50,090
and that's why I extend myself through

144
00:05:47,009 --> 00:05:54,089
this service of sharing my journey

145
00:05:50,089 --> 00:05:57,019
sharing my ideas and supporting you as

146
00:05:54,089 --> 00:05:57,019
