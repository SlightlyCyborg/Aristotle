00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,870
today<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm excited to be speaking with</font>

2
00:00:01,589 --> 00:00:06,778
<font color="#CCCCCC">Elliott Hulse professional</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> strongman</font>

3
00:00:03,870 --> 00:00:08,969
strength coach and author you<font color="#CCCCCC"> can know</font>

4
00:00:06,778 --> 00:00:11,460
exactly how<font color="#E5E5E5"> to lose weight but still be</font>

5
00:00:08,970 --> 00:00:14,730
obese what I invite<font color="#E5E5E5"> people to do is to</font>

6
00:00:11,460 --> 00:00:17,010
realize that<font color="#CCCCCC"> no matter what you know and</font>

7
00:00:14,730 --> 00:00:20,039
what you even do because that's just no

8
00:00:17,010 --> 00:00:22,820
one step closer to to the roots of

9
00:00:20,039 --> 00:00:26,310
what's transformational it's who you are

10
00:00:22,820 --> 00:00:29,820
that's important my uncle was<font color="#E5E5E5"> a gymnast</font>

11
00:00:26,309 --> 00:00:31,678
a martial artist he ran marathons he was

12
00:00:29,820 --> 00:00:33,869
a bodybuilder and I was four years old

13
00:00:31,678 --> 00:00:36,119
and here's this guy he was essentially

14
00:00:33,869 --> 00:00:38,369
Superman because we can do standing back

15
00:00:36,119 --> 00:00:40,339
flips and why break bricks in half with

16
00:00:38,369 --> 00:00:43,589
his hands so<font color="#E5E5E5"> you could just imagine that</font>

17
00:00:40,340 --> 00:00:45,629
my consciousness the way I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font>

18
00:00:43,590 --> 00:00:48,270
rises out of an environment<font color="#E5E5E5"> where at a</font>

19
00:00:45,628 --> 00:00:50,218
very young age it<font color="#E5E5E5"> was like well you know</font>

20
00:00:48,270 --> 00:00:52,020
<font color="#E5E5E5">you can actually do things that Superman</font>

21
00:00:50,219 --> 00:00:54,270
dude I was like walk on your hands<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

22
00:00:52,020 --> 00:00:55,469
do backflips and chop bricks and you

23
00:00:54,270 --> 00:00:58,140
don't put anything in your body that

24
00:00:55,469 --> 00:01:00,329
doesn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> support vitality these had</font>

25
00:00:58,140 --> 00:01:01,890
talked about<font color="#E5E5E5"> how even at</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> your you know</font>

26
00:01:00,329 --> 00:01:04,379
<font color="#E5E5E5">lowest point financially</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you still</font>

27
00:01:01,890 --> 00:01:06,900
focused on eating healthy foods and

28
00:01:04,379 --> 00:01:08,909
investing in your<font color="#E5E5E5"> body because that kind</font>

29
00:01:06,900 --> 00:01:10,409
<font color="#E5E5E5">of seeds into everything else who the</font>

30
00:01:08,909 --> 00:01:12,000
<font color="#E5E5E5">jury literally becomes the cells of your</font>

31
00:01:10,409 --> 00:01:13,590
body I mean you want to think<font color="#E5E5E5"> better</font>

32
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:15,810
consider what your brain cells are being

33
00:01:13,590 --> 00:01:18,659
made up and how to strength ty internet

34
00:01:15,810 --> 00:01:20,250
<font color="#CCCCCC">was</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the vehicle through which you you</font>

35
00:01:18,659 --> 00:01:22,560
approach this world you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> it was your</font>

36
00:01:20,250 --> 00:01:24,780
body you're physically weak I don't see

37
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:28,530
how you could<font color="#CCCCCC"> be mentally strong</font>

38
00:01:24,780 --> 00:01:30,930
emotionally strong what happens in our

39
00:01:28,530 --> 00:01:33,060
mind happens in our body what's

40
00:01:30,930 --> 00:01:35,130
happening in our body is linked<font color="#CCCCCC"> to our</font>

41
00:01:33,060 --> 00:01:36,240
mind so there's really no separating

42
00:01:35,129 --> 00:01:37,589
them if you want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to become more</font>

43
00:01:36,239 --> 00:01:40,109
<font color="#E5E5E5">intelligent to have better relationships</font>

44
00:01:37,590 --> 00:01:42,859
you want to make more<font color="#E5E5E5"> money it begins</font>

45
00:01:40,109 --> 00:01:45,599
with the mind and the mind literally

46
00:01:42,859 --> 00:01:46,978
drops down into the body via the

47
00:01:45,599 --> 00:01:48,059
peripheral nervous system so that's a

48
00:01:46,978 --> 00:01:49,950
great plan never thought about it that

49
00:01:48,060 --> 00:01:51,299
way you know we think of our mind kind

50
00:01:49,950 --> 00:01:53,880
<font color="#E5E5E5">of a separate thing but it literally</font>

51
00:01:51,299 --> 00:01:55,680
connects into your physical body yeah

52
00:01:53,879 --> 00:01:57,810
okay there's no separation between the

53
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:59,790
neocortex the cortex and medulla and the

54
00:01:57,810 --> 00:02:02,368
<font color="#E5E5E5">brainstem and what does the brainstem do</font>

55
00:01:59,790 --> 00:02:04,380
that do it branches out into the organs

56
00:02:02,368 --> 00:02:06,000
and the muscle so it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> like your youth</font>

57
00:02:04,379 --> 00:02:07,408
returning your bicep but really<font color="#CCCCCC"> you're</font>

58
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,848
<font color="#CCCCCC">you're trimming your brain you're</font>

59
00:02:07,409 --> 00:02:11,360
training your mind yeah it's all

60
00:02:08,848 --> 00:02:12,840
interconnected what are the biggest

61
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:15,510
frustrations<font color="#E5E5E5"> or</font>

62
00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:17,340
your clients there well it's not the one

63
00:02:15,509 --> 00:02:18,870
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> they think</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it is they've got this</font>

64
00:02:17,340 --> 00:02:21,330
thing that they think is their problem

65
00:02:18,870 --> 00:02:23,509
but really when you take a good look<font color="#E5E5E5"> at</font>

66
00:02:21,330 --> 00:02:26,190
it<font color="#E5E5E5"> you realize that that is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> just the</font>

67
00:02:23,509 --> 00:02:28,799
manifestation of a deeper problem that

68
00:02:26,189 --> 00:02:30,780
you didn't see so growing stronger

69
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:32,459
physically a lot of<font color="#CCCCCC"> people say well yeah</font>

70
00:02:30,780 --> 00:02:34,590
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know what I'd like to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> deadlift more</font>

74
00:02:39,598 --> 00:02:43,679
what you do so focusing on who you are

75
00:02:41,189 --> 00:02:44,939
<font color="#CCCCCC">is more important so you can come to me</font>

76
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:47,640
and say well<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Elliott and I want six</font>

80
00:02:53,848 --> 00:02:57,649

81
00:02:55,860 --> 00:03:00,329
those muscles is completely shut off

82
00:02:57,650 --> 00:03:03,539
because<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're on medication or you're</font>

83
00:03:00,329 --> 00:03:05,909
eating foods that potentially shut down

84
00:03:03,539 --> 00:03:07,590
the the nervous systems connect you know

85
00:03:05,909 --> 00:03:09,449
your ability to turn all those muscles

86
00:03:07,590 --> 00:03:11,700
we<font color="#CCCCCC"> can take it one step further and say</font>
