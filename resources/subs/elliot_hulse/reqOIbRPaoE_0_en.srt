00:00:00,530 --> 00:00:05,250
so it's been said that a man's life<font color="#E5E5E5"> is a</font>

2
00:00:03,060 --> 00:00:08,970
product of the activities that he most

3
00:00:05,250 --> 00:00:12,230
often repeats basically you become which

4
00:00:08,970 --> 00:00:15,528
are habits dictate your habits act as a

5
00:00:12,230 --> 00:00:18,210
scaffolding on which you build your life

6
00:00:15,528 --> 00:00:22,050
ever<font color="#E5E5E5"> since I was 14 years old I've</font>

7
00:00:18,210 --> 00:00:24,510
always lifted barbells I thought<font color="#E5E5E5"> about</font>

8
00:00:22,050 --> 00:00:27,778
this this<font color="#CCCCCC"> morning and my life is a</font>

9
00:00:24,510 --> 00:00:30,179
<font color="#CCCCCC">metaphor for barbell strength I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> used</font>

10
00:00:27,778 --> 00:00:33,149
strength as a metaphor for every area<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

11
00:00:30,178 --> 00:00:35,969
life and if you've watched my videos for

12
00:00:33,149 --> 00:00:38,609
a<font color="#CCCCCC"> while you know this during the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> good</font>

13
00:00:35,969 --> 00:00:40,950
times<font color="#E5E5E5"> the barbell was always a habit</font>

14
00:00:38,609 --> 00:00:45,509
during the bad times the barbell was

15
00:00:40,950 --> 00:00:48,480
always there strength training<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

16
00:00:45,509 --> 00:00:51,920
lifting barbells is the habit that acts

17
00:00:48,479 --> 00:00:56,308
as the glue that<font color="#E5E5E5"> holds my life together</font>

18
00:00:51,920 --> 00:01:00,929
so my question today is what habit are

19
00:00:56,308 --> 00:01:03,209
you instilling and allowing to guide you

20
00:01:00,929 --> 00:01:06,228
down the path to which you will end up

21
00:01:03,210 --> 00:01:06,228
in your life
