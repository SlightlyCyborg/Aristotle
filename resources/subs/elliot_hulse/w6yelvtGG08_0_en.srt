of myself in these four areas we've got

11
00:00:23,070 --> 00:00:27,689
vocation the work that you do the

12
00:00:25,649 --> 00:00:30,288
<font color="#E5E5E5">service you provide to the world you've</font>

13
00:00:27,689 --> 00:00:32,640
got education your level of mastery

14
00:00:30,289 --> 00:00:34,920
you've got health and fitness which is

15
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:37,969
pretty self-explanatory and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm in a gym</font>

16
00:00:34,920 --> 00:00:39,960
is that's what<font color="#E5E5E5"> we do</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> here and of course</font>

17
00:00:37,969 --> 00:00:41,879
relationships and I was<font color="#E5E5E5"> really pleased</font>

18
00:00:39,960 --> 00:00:43,620
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> read all of your responses I enjoyed</font>

19
00:00:41,878 --> 00:00:45,628
hearing the things that you guys had to

20
00:00:43,619 --> 00:00:47,849
say and learning a little bit more<font color="#E5E5E5"> about</font>

21
00:00:45,628 --> 00:00:49,799
you and as I<font color="#E5E5E5"> was reading through the</font>

22
00:00:47,850 --> 00:00:52,140
responses i began<font color="#CCCCCC"> to notice certain</font>

23
00:00:49,799 --> 00:00:54,599
recurring themes and today<font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> want to</font>

24
00:00:52,140 --> 00:00:56,909
talk a<font color="#E5E5E5"> little bit about maybe even ask</font>

25
00:00:54,600 --> 00:00:58,789
another question as it relates<font color="#CCCCCC"> to one of</font>

26
00:00:56,909 --> 00:01:02,250
the recurring themes that I notice and

27
00:00:58,789 --> 00:01:03,588
the area in which<font color="#E5E5E5"> i'd like to speak a</font>

28
00:01:02,250 --> 00:01:06,719
little bit more<font color="#E5E5E5"> with you about today is</font>

29
00:01:03,588 --> 00:01:09,420
relationships and the question<font color="#E5E5E5"> is how do</font>

30
00:01:06,719 --> 00:01:11,429
we grow stronger when we're in an

31
00:01:09,420 --> 00:01:13,409
environment with people who are set on

32
00:01:11,430 --> 00:01:15,960
not becoming stronger versions of

33
00:01:13,409 --> 00:01:17,990
ourselves themselves so for example if

34
00:01:15,959 --> 00:01:20,158
you are fed up with being overweight

35
00:01:17,989 --> 00:01:22,259
you've been overweight your whole life

36
00:01:20,159 --> 00:01:23,939
or a significant portion of it your mom

37
00:01:22,259 --> 00:01:25,950
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> dad are overweight Grandma and</font>

38
00:01:23,938 --> 00:01:27,839
Grandpa overweight your brothers and

39
00:01:25,950 --> 00:01:30,390
sisters your friends are all<font color="#E5E5E5"> over weight</font>

40
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:32,609
eating fried chicken pizza<font color="#E5E5E5"> two liters</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

41
00:01:30,390 --> 00:01:34,829
coca-cola and french fries and potato

42
00:01:32,609 --> 00:01:36,540
<font color="#E5E5E5">chips every single day and you decide</font>

43
00:01:34,828 --> 00:01:37,889
I'm fed up I had enough I could be more

44
00:01:36,540 --> 00:01:41,939
I can have more I could do more I'm

45
00:01:37,890 --> 00:01:43,799
gonna<font color="#E5E5E5"> make</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> this happen but yet every day</font>

46
00:01:41,938 --> 00:01:46,078
you come<font color="#CCCCCC"> home and you got to face them</font>

47
00:01:43,799 --> 00:01:47,759
you got to face the nasty food they eat

48
00:01:46,078 --> 00:01:50,009
and you might even have<font color="#E5E5E5"> to face some</font>

49
00:01:47,759 --> 00:01:53,129
criticism when dealing with these people

50
00:01:50,009 --> 00:01:56,430
who quite frankly our loved ones so the

51
00:01:53,129 --> 00:01:58,399
<font color="#CCCCCC">question really is how do</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we grow</font>

52
00:01:56,430 --> 00:02:02,310
stronger in this environment without

53
00:01:58,399 --> 00:02:04,290
creating animosity towards these people

54
00:02:02,310 --> 00:02:07,140
without creating division separation and

55
00:02:04,290 --> 00:02:09,209
criticism against the<font color="#E5E5E5"> people who we love</font>

56
00:02:07,140 --> 00:02:11,270
and who are in our environment<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm</font>

58
00:02:11,270 --> 00:02:16,610
I have to say<font color="#CCCCCC"> about growing stronger in</font>

59
00:02:13,310 --> 00:02:19,340
an environment that is<font color="#E5E5E5"> set on not moving</font>

60
00:02:16,610 --> 00:02:22,520
forward<font color="#E5E5E5"> with you and the key to the</font>

61
00:02:19,340 --> 00:02:25,969
answer and response would be were you

00:02:22,520 --> 00:02:28,850
able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to or how could you maintain a good</font>

63
00:02:25,969 --> 00:02:31,129
relationship with those people<font color="#E5E5E5"> while you</font>
