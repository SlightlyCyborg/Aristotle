66
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:34,260
about the fucking juice you know like I

67
00:02:32,310 --> 00:02:35,759
would tell people like you know this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

68
00:02:34,259 --> 00:02:40,379
really cool business opportunity because

69
00:02:35,759 --> 00:02:42,299
it was and the juice tastes good but I

70
00:02:40,379 --> 00:02:43,650
just could not justify I could not look

71
00:02:42,300 --> 00:02:46,260
people in the eye and be like<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay yeah</font>

72
00:02:43,650 --> 00:02:48,480
so it's forty dollars a bottle of those

work for<font color="#CCCCCC"> you I felt like a douche bag</font>

77
00:02:56,159 --> 00:02:59,789
again it has nothing to do with the

78
00:02:58,259 --> 00:03:01,729
model<font color="#E5E5E5"> of multi-level marketing or</font>
