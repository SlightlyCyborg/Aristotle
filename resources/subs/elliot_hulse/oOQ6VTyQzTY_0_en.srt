00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,480
hey whats up guys<font color="#CCCCCC"> Elliott Hulse here and</font>

2
00:00:01,679 --> 00:00:06,269
as you're probably well aware I've been

3
00:00:03,480 --> 00:00:08,789
making<font color="#CCCCCC"> YouTube videos since 2007 on</font>

4
00:00:06,269 --> 00:00:11,009
various aspects of becoming what I call

5
00:00:08,789 --> 00:00:12,449
the strongest version yourself right and

6
00:00:11,009 --> 00:00:14,939
of course<font color="#CCCCCC"> that includes physical fitness</font>

7
00:00:12,449 --> 00:00:16,829
but it also includes mental fitness and

8
00:00:14,939 --> 00:00:19,259
I love more<font color="#CCCCCC"> than anything</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to talk about</font>

9
00:00:16,829 --> 00:00:21,149
these two various topics I enjoy making

10
00:00:19,260 --> 00:00:23,279
these videos and I enjoy speaking with

11
00:00:21,149 --> 00:00:26,820
you so don't get me wrong when I say

12
00:00:23,278 --> 00:00:28,349
only so much can be said right you got

13
00:00:26,820 --> 00:00:30,689
to actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> do the thing in order to</font>

14
00:00:28,349 --> 00:00:32,368
have<font color="#E5E5E5"> the power</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and growing stronger</font>

15
00:00:30,689 --> 00:00:35,238
becoming stronger version yourself it's

16
00:00:32,368 --> 00:00:38,039
less of an idea or a philosophy or

17
00:00:35,238 --> 00:00:41,099
something to talk about and it's more of

18
00:00:38,039 --> 00:00:45,109
a way<font color="#CCCCCC"> of being so I'm really</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> glad</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

19
00:00:41,100 --> 00:00:48,090
introduce you<font color="#CCCCCC"> to the grow stronger</font>

20
00:00:45,109 --> 00:00:49,500
experience where I'm going to be

21
00:00:48,090 --> 00:00:51,750
<font color="#E5E5E5">traveling to various cities throughout</font>

22
00:00:49,500 --> 00:00:53,670
<font color="#CCCCCC">the US and Europe over</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the course of the</font>

23
00:00:51,750 --> 00:00:55,170
next few months not<font color="#E5E5E5"> to give you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> another</font>

24
00:00:53,670 --> 00:00:56,760
talk because we've got enough of<font color="#E5E5E5"> those</font>

25
00:00:55,170 --> 00:00:58,770
right where the teacher stands at the

26
00:00:56,759 --> 00:01:00,750
front of the classroom and you sit tight

27
00:00:58,770 --> 00:01:02,850
and take notes while he feels your head

28
00:01:00,750 --> 00:01:05,250
with more information<font color="#E5E5E5"> philosophy and</font>

29
00:01:02,850 --> 00:01:07,978
fancy phrases we don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> need any</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> more of</font>

30
00:01:05,250 --> 00:01:11,250
that this is going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be an experience</font>

31
00:01:07,978 --> 00:01:14,429
where we dig deeply into the

32
00:01:11,250 --> 00:01:16,560
uncomfortable parts of who you are and

33
00:01:14,430 --> 00:01:19,799
who<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're being we're going</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

34
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:23,240
experience and expose ourselves to the

35
00:01:19,799 --> 00:01:25,560
shadow aspects<font color="#E5E5E5"> of what keeps us small</font>

36
00:01:23,239 --> 00:01:28,319
you're also<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to be exposed to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

37
00:01:25,560 --> 00:01:30,240
<font color="#E5E5E5">Magnificent radiant light of yourself</font>

38
00:01:28,319 --> 00:01:33,179
you're fully embody itself and all that

39
00:01:30,239 --> 00:01:36,959
you could be we're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to use music</font>

40
00:01:33,180 --> 00:01:41,670
dance and chanting they'll<font color="#E5E5E5"> be laughter</font>

41
00:01:36,959 --> 00:01:45,719
some anger maybe some tears but we'll

42
00:01:41,670 --> 00:01:47,609
use affirmation art and ecstasy in order

43
00:01:45,719 --> 00:01:48,950
to get our hands dirty we're gonna get

44
00:01:47,609 --> 00:01:51,500
sweaty

45
00:01:48,950 --> 00:01:53,899
the gritty and dirty digging into the

46
00:01:51,500 --> 00:01:56,840
depths of our being in order to discover

47
00:01:53,899 --> 00:02:01,239
all that we are<font color="#CCCCCC"> and all that we could be</font>

48
00:01:56,840 --> 00:02:01,240
I will see you there
