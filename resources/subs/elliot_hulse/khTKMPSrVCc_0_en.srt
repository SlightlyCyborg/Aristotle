1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,349
all right to go under like spiritual

2
00:00:01,800 --> 00:00:05,819
stuff with you someone who is<font color="#CCCCCC"> like I'm</font>

3
00:00:04,349 --> 00:00:08,879
sure about their religious place or

4
00:00:05,819 --> 00:00:10,740
there's some sort of a philosophy in

5
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:12,870
general mm-hmm what do you suggest

6
00:00:10,740 --> 00:00:14,910
indoors is like get that certainty and

7
00:00:12,869 --> 00:00:16,410
then once you do get<font color="#E5E5E5"> it like let's say</font>

8
00:00:14,910 --> 00:00:18,118
it goes against what your family

9
00:00:16,410 --> 00:00:20,490
<font color="#E5E5E5">believes or someone who's really close</font>

10
00:00:18,118 --> 00:00:26,099
to you how do you convey that to them

11
00:00:20,489 --> 00:00:29,189
without getting crucified yeah cuz we

12
00:00:26,099 --> 00:00:32,609
crucify people so basically go against

13
00:00:29,189 --> 00:00:34,679
everything else right literally Jesus

14
00:00:32,609 --> 00:00:36,929
with crazy motherfucker he basically<font color="#CCCCCC"> was</font>

15
00:00:34,679 --> 00:00:40,229
like look all this religious shit you

16
00:00:36,929 --> 00:00:42,179
guys talk about bullshit and he<font color="#E5E5E5"> went to</font>

17
00:00:40,229 --> 00:00:45,000
<font color="#CCCCCC">the political leaders put their tables</font>

18
00:00:42,179 --> 00:00:46,649
and gave the finger<font color="#E5E5E5"> to the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> so he fucked</font>

19
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:48,058
all<font color="#CCCCCC"> the political at all the religious</font>

20
00:00:46,649 --> 00:00:51,920
leaders<font color="#CCCCCC"> before they come spite of that</font>

21
00:00:48,058 --> 00:00:55,640
that's a rebellious mood right<font color="#E5E5E5"> there so</font>

22
00:00:51,920 --> 00:01:02,149
few years where I think you might<font color="#CCCCCC"> be</font>

23
00:00:55,640 --> 00:01:02,149
tripping over stumbling block certainty

24
00:01:03,350 --> 00:01:10,349
there is no certainty and to confine

25
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:13,469
yourself to a version<font color="#CCCCCC"> of yourself that</font>

26
00:01:10,349 --> 00:01:15,989
has adopted a particular idea that is

27
00:01:13,469 --> 00:01:18,269
resourceful for the time and then

28
00:01:15,989 --> 00:01:21,000
<font color="#E5E5E5">calling it certainty which means that</font>

29
00:01:18,269 --> 00:01:23,519
<font color="#E5E5E5">you can't navigate outside of it and you</font>

30
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:26,640
just<font color="#E5E5E5"> put yourself in prison in that</font>

31
00:01:23,519 --> 00:01:29,759
prison is the same<font color="#CCCCCC"> person that's the</font>

32
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:32,159
Muslim the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Jew the Christian all find</font>

33
00:01:29,759 --> 00:01:34,228
themselves in and people<font color="#E5E5E5"> like their</font>

34
00:01:32,159 --> 00:01:36,329
prisons and they don't want<font color="#E5E5E5"> anybody else</font>

35
00:01:34,228 --> 00:01:38,129
talking about any other prisons they end

36
00:01:36,328 --> 00:01:42,239
up biting each other so I find<font color="#E5E5E5"> there</font>

37
00:01:38,129 --> 00:01:44,158
that abs are the<font color="#E5E5E5"> same fucking prison as</font>

38
00:01:42,239 --> 00:01:47,819
questions it's like you're so be able to

39
00:01:44,159 --> 00:01:51,570
just about being ages certain temp is a

40
00:01:47,819 --> 00:01:54,289
dangerous worth it what's the line if

41
00:01:51,569 --> 00:01:56,729
you don't have certain

42
00:01:54,290 --> 00:01:59,880
please do<font color="#E5E5E5"> like the person I don't</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know</font>

43
00:01:56,730 --> 00:02:02,300
<font color="#CCCCCC">like how he was talking about</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> other</font>

44
00:01:59,879 --> 00:02:06,869
people to find you switch for free

45
00:02:02,299 --> 00:02:09,990
because I wanted<font color="#E5E5E5"> to know what I was once</font>

46
00:02:06,870 --> 00:02:12,629
human brain said that none of the labels

47
00:02:09,990 --> 00:02:15,480
that were given<font color="#E5E5E5"> no the labels that we</font>

48
00:02:12,629 --> 00:02:19,859
adopt number none of the names or forms

49
00:02:15,479 --> 00:02:26,009
that we worship because we worship idols

50
00:02:19,860 --> 00:02:27,840
idols meaning concrete concrete examples

51
00:02:26,009 --> 00:02:30,389
or concrete expressions of that which is

52
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:32,930
abstract<font color="#CCCCCC"> any time that we attach to</font>

53
00:02:30,389 --> 00:02:35,759
these things names what's your name

54
00:02:32,930 --> 00:02:37,920
Austin you're not Austin Austin as a

55
00:02:35,759 --> 00:02:40,620
name that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> made up of symbols that they</font>

56
00:02:37,919 --> 00:02:43,679
call letters you're not in Austin that's

57
00:02:40,620 --> 00:02:45,120
a name we don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> worship when we don't</font>

58
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:49,110
attach to we don't personally

59
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:58,709
identifiable austin casey we're like

60
00:02:49,110 --> 00:03:01,320
going again the question is are<font color="#CCCCCC"> you get</font>

61
00:02:58,709 --> 00:03:03,239
the certainty<font color="#E5E5E5"> like here's the most</font>

62
00:03:01,319 --> 00:03:05,459
beautiful thing about life is that there

63
00:03:03,239 --> 00:03:08,280
is<font color="#CCCCCC"> no certainty that's what makes like</font>

64
00:03:05,459 --> 00:03:10,319
so freaking fantastic<font color="#E5E5E5"> is that you never</font>

65
00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:11,640
know what's going to happen we want to

66
00:03:10,319 --> 00:03:13,019
know what's<font color="#CCCCCC"> going to happen because</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we</font>

67
00:03:11,639 --> 00:03:15,089
think<font color="#E5E5E5"> that if we know what's going</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

68
00:03:13,019 --> 00:03:16,799
happen then we were navigating the right

69
00:03:15,090 --> 00:03:19,200
path and then we're going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> get the</font>

70
00:03:16,799 --> 00:03:21,120
right thing go right way but<font color="#E5E5E5"> really</font>

71
00:03:19,199 --> 00:03:22,859
that's a figment of our imagination life

72
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:24,420
is so freaking dynamic we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> just</font>

73
00:03:22,860 --> 00:03:28,049
talking about quantum physics before

74
00:03:24,419 --> 00:03:30,768
we're simply the invention given to a

75
00:03:28,049 --> 00:03:33,810
type of particle changes that particles

76
00:03:30,769 --> 00:03:36,659
to say that there is<font color="#CCCCCC"> a certainty in any</font>

77
00:03:33,810 --> 00:03:37,979
way shape<font color="#CCCCCC"> or form not only this kids is</font>

78
00:03:36,659 --> 00:03:41,219
a figment of our imagination but it's

79
00:03:37,979 --> 00:03:44,129
boring<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's well if somebody</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> gave</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

80
00:03:41,219 --> 00:03:45,329
every step that you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to take and</font>

81
00:03:44,129 --> 00:03:46,680
all the experiences you're going to have

82
00:03:45,329 --> 00:03:49,110
and the path<font color="#CCCCCC"> that you're going to</font>

83
00:03:46,680 --> 00:03:51,920
traverse from now to the day you die so

84
00:03:49,110 --> 00:03:51,920
<font color="#CCCCCC">that you're certain</font>

85
00:03:54,300 --> 00:03:58,770
that's that they have the person I can't

86
00:03:57,210 --> 00:04:00,390
wait<font color="#CCCCCC"> to see what's gonna happen all</font>

87
00:03:58,770 --> 00:04:02,189
right what you guys go<font color="#E5E5E5"> to dinner for</font>

88
00:04:00,389 --> 00:04:04,139
this night I don't know what's gonna

89
00:04:02,189 --> 00:04:05,039
happen<font color="#CCCCCC"> I can't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> wait</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to see but</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you know</font>

90
00:04:04,139 --> 00:04:20,009
what<font color="#CCCCCC"> if I already knew what was it</font>

91
00:04:05,039 --> 00:04:24,029
happen ah minute all right<font color="#E5E5E5"> this equal be</font>

92
00:04:20,009 --> 00:04:28,289
some strange reason out<font color="#E5E5E5"> of fear you want</font>

93
00:04:24,029 --> 00:04:30,539
certainty we want predictability but

94
00:04:28,290 --> 00:04:34,980
it's it's under source one that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> pretty</font>

95
00:04:30,540 --> 00:04:36,810
boring groundedness within your body

96
00:04:34,980 --> 00:04:40,110
breathing into your balls having your

97
00:04:36,810 --> 00:04:46,050
feet throw the ground awareness allows

98
00:04:40,110 --> 00:04:50,490
you to traverse all the dynamic all the

99
00:04:46,050 --> 00:04:52,410
dynamism<font color="#CCCCCC"> on the world short wouldn't you</font>

100
00:04:50,490 --> 00:04:55,980
want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be sure footed you don't</font>

101
00:04:52,410 --> 00:04:58,020
necessarily want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be certain short</font>

102
00:04:55,980 --> 00:04:59,850
foot it means whatever happens like

103
00:04:58,019 --> 00:05:04,879
Peter on the ground and I can deal with

104
00:04:59,850 --> 00:05:07,980
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> looking I can navigate I'm</font>

105
00:05:04,879 --> 00:05:12,569
responsible you want to be responsible

106
00:05:07,980 --> 00:05:14,850
not certain certain means boring and

107
00:05:12,569 --> 00:05:16,860
already and you're like most certain to

108
00:05:14,850 --> 00:05:21,060
use will people certainty their

109
00:05:16,860 --> 00:05:23,669
certainty is a projection of the future

110
00:05:21,060 --> 00:05:25,230
of what happened in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> past this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

111
00:05:23,668 --> 00:05:27,029
<font color="#E5E5E5">what we love this will</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> be more certainty</font>

112
00:05:25,230 --> 00:05:29,069
this is the way it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> always been done</font>

113
00:05:27,029 --> 00:05:30,719
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is the way your daddy did it your</font>

114
00:05:29,069 --> 00:05:33,509
granddaddy did big grin that he did it

115
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:38,660
this is what the book says this is what

116
00:05:33,509 --> 00:05:42,360
scientists say so basically<font color="#E5E5E5"> Oh past</font>

117
00:05:38,660 --> 00:05:48,650
projected on the<font color="#E5E5E5"> future past is dead all</font>

118
00:05:42,360 --> 00:05:50,900
that matters is that step and that step

119
00:05:48,649 --> 00:05:53,329
and are you aware each time you're

120
00:05:50,899 --> 00:06:09,620
<font color="#CCCCCC">taking a step and are you sure put it as</font>

121
00:05:53,329 --> 00:06:11,209
a reverse your path into<font color="#CCCCCC"> the unknown the</font>

122
00:06:09,620 --> 00:06:13,069
world always wants their thing for you

123
00:06:11,209 --> 00:06:14,508
we spoke about parents<font color="#E5E5E5"> and children and</font>

124
00:06:13,069 --> 00:06:16,849
banging<font color="#E5E5E5"> and not giving them your</font>

125
00:06:14,509 --> 00:06:19,009
thoughts you're a particular way you're

126
00:06:16,850 --> 00:06:20,360
thinking a particular way you're going

127
00:06:19,009 --> 00:06:22,550
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> have your own children when you're</font>

128
00:06:20,360 --> 00:06:24,199
dealing with your<font color="#E5E5E5"> parents</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> my some shit</font>

129
00:06:22,550 --> 00:06:30,439
<font color="#E5E5E5">out of your</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> parents have a particular</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">belief okay which is to gonna die soon I</font>

131
00:06:30,439 --> 00:06:47,180
don't think that's how humans<font color="#E5E5E5"> evolve and</font>

132
00:06:41,348 --> 00:06:50,000
ideas ideas are the other<font color="#E5E5E5"> food into the</font>

133
00:06:47,180 --> 00:06:52,459
future so that idea is going to die with

134
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:55,639
her that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay grandma you're so sweet</font>

135
00:06:52,459 --> 00:06:59,598
that's nice over<font color="#E5E5E5"> here doing what I know</font>

136
00:06:55,639 --> 00:07:01,220
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> future holds what you're feeling in</font>

137
00:06:59,598 --> 00:07:03,288
your body is<font color="#E5E5E5"> what the future holds</font>

138
00:07:01,220 --> 00:07:04,930
there's no need to judge it we like to

139
00:07:03,288 --> 00:07:08,089
judge it and say like it's wrong

140
00:07:04,930 --> 00:07:11,030
conservativism don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> Traverse don't move</font>

141
00:07:08,089 --> 00:07:12,679
too far from the tradition right but

142
00:07:11,029 --> 00:07:14,899
<font color="#E5E5E5">everything that we experience that's</font>

143
00:07:12,680 --> 00:07:16,280
good everything<font color="#E5E5E5"> to enact any sense are</font>

144
00:07:14,899 --> 00:07:18,829

147
00:07:21,620 --> 00:07:25,250
are bad or that good or under source for

148
00:07:23,569 --> 00:07:27,769
that there are many structures within it

149
00:07:25,250 --> 00:07:30,949
that we need to reintegrate lot of the

150
00:07:27,769 --> 00:07:34,129
disciplines a lot a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the rituals I</font>

151
00:07:30,949 --> 00:07:36,680
think we become so progressive that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we</font>

152
00:07:34,129 --> 00:07:38,569
lost the power<font color="#CCCCCC"> of ritual you lost power</font>

153
00:07:36,680 --> 00:07:39,340
of myth you've lost a<font color="#CCCCCC"> lot of the</font>

00:07:38,569 --> 00:07:42,149
structures

155

maybe religion very powerful in<font color="#E5E5E5"> our</font>

moving forward<font color="#CCCCCC"> but I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> think I'm feeling</font>

157
00:07:44,889 --> 00:07:49,030
is going to come back it's going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to be</font>

158
00:07:46,569 --> 00:07:51,310
vested in a different way they're all a

159
00:07:49,029 --> 00:07:55,589
product of letting<font color="#CCCCCC"> go a lot of times</font>

160
00:07:51,310 --> 00:07:58,889
you're letting go of is not the truth

161
00:07:55,589 --> 00:08:04,359
it's not the structure it's not the

162
00:07:58,889 --> 00:08:06,879
context of what's being used through

163
00:08:04,360 --> 00:08:10,740
religion and philosophy it's the content

164
00:08:06,879 --> 00:08:14,680
of it that's usually<font color="#E5E5E5"> Doppler</font>

165
00:08:10,740 --> 00:08:16,090
superstition the content changes from

166
00:08:14,680 --> 00:08:18,720
generation to generation you<font color="#E5E5E5"> study the</font>

167
00:08:16,089 --> 00:08:24,310
story of<font color="#CCCCCC"> Jesus and then you studied the</font>

00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:26,350
next several old like Greek religions

169
00:08:24,310 --> 00:08:28,509
the story is exactly the same i wish i

170
00:08:26,350 --> 00:08:31,539
could repeated here know exactly

171
00:08:28,509 --> 00:08:34,240
historically good was but the gods prior

172
00:08:31,538 --> 00:08:36,250
to Jesus were born of a virgin rose from

174
00:08:36,250 --> 00:08:42,038
exact story that context is the same<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

175
00:08:39,639 --> 00:08:44,409
content changed<font color="#E5E5E5"> well this guy is called</font>

even<font color="#CCCCCC"> it like we were completely</font>

179
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:54,180
detaching from and squashing all of the

180

things from<font color="#CCCCCC"> the past it's essentially</font>

181
00:08:56,769 --> 00:09:01,870
we're moving forward into a more
