00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,200
hey what's up<font color="#E5E5E5"> guys in today's blog post</font>

2
00:00:01,949 --> 00:00:06,028
<font color="#E5E5E5">I talked about the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> five by five training</font>

3
00:00:04,200 --> 00:00:07,890
program that my<font color="#CCCCCC"> uncle put me on when I</font>

4
00:00:06,028 --> 00:00:10,019
was 14 years old and I first started

5
00:00:07,889 --> 00:00:11,968
training and specifically the

6
00:00:10,019 --> 00:00:13,679
modifications that he had to make in

7
00:00:11,968 --> 00:00:15,928
order to correct some of the muscular

8
00:00:13,679 --> 00:00:18,448
imbalances I was dealing with<font color="#E5E5E5"> so I</font>

9
00:00:15,929 --> 00:00:20,100
thought about<font color="#E5E5E5"> today's video and how I</font>

10
00:00:18,449 --> 00:00:22,279
wanted<font color="#E5E5E5"> to approach it and I want to talk</font>

11
00:00:20,100 --> 00:00:24,750
to<font color="#CCCCCC"> you guys about in balance</font>

12
00:00:22,278 --> 00:00:26,550
specifically muscular imbalance and as

13
00:00:24,750 --> 00:00:28,890
it relates to<font color="#E5E5E5"> the training programs that</font>

14
00:00:26,550 --> 00:00:31,170
we choose<font color="#CCCCCC"> to engage in now before</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I get</font>

16
00:00:31,170 --> 00:00:34,800
channel and I have a<font color="#E5E5E5"> strength camp</font>

17
00:00:32,700 --> 00:00:36,719
channel it's all about strength training

18
00:00:34,799 --> 00:00:40,500
<font color="#E5E5E5">and fitness and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> whatnot but if you're</font>

19
00:00:36,719 --> 00:00:42,000
watching this channel and you're on the

20
00:00:40,500 --> 00:00:44,399
journey of<font color="#E5E5E5"> becoming a stronger version</font>

21
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:46,079
of yourself understand<font color="#E5E5E5"> that the body</font>

22
00:00:44,399 --> 00:00:48,390
cannot be separate from this there are

23
00:00:46,079 --> 00:00:50,640
<font color="#E5E5E5">so many gurus out there that teach you</font>

24
00:00:48,390 --> 00:00:53,520
meditation and or how to eat a

25
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:55,259
particular type of special diet right

26
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:58,410
and they all plan about these particular

27
00:00:55,259 --> 00:01:00,599
ideas leaving out certain things my

28
00:00:58,409 --> 00:01:01,858
approach<font color="#CCCCCC"> is a holistic one you've</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> been</font>

29
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:03,600
watching<font color="#E5E5E5"> me long enough you've heard me</font>

30
00:01:01,859 --> 00:01:06,118
talk about the four layers of strength

31
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:08,129
there are four facets to becoming a

32
00:01:06,118 --> 00:01:12,090
stronger version yourself and the very

33
00:01:08,129 --> 00:01:13,649
first<font color="#CCCCCC"> one is physical health not just</font>

34
00:01:12,090 --> 00:01:17,210
your digestive health not just your

35
00:01:13,650 --> 00:01:19,590
hormone health not just you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know</font>

36
00:01:17,209 --> 00:01:21,179
physiological health in general when I

37
00:01:19,590 --> 00:01:24,090
say that that's the second layer of

38
00:01:21,180 --> 00:01:28,350
strength I'm talking about your actual

39
00:01:24,090 --> 00:01:31,710
muscular system your body your shoulders

40
00:01:28,349 --> 00:01:35,489
your arms your your jaw your legs your

41
00:01:31,709 --> 00:01:36,899
feet your core and how they all

42
00:01:35,489 --> 00:01:38,489
contribute to being a stronger version

43
00:01:36,900 --> 00:01:40,650
of yourself in all areas your life so

44
00:01:38,489 --> 00:01:42,298
those of you who are longtime Elliott

45
00:01:40,650 --> 00:01:43,950
Hulse fans you probably know this and I

46
00:01:42,299 --> 00:01:48,090
<font color="#E5E5E5">just kind of reiterate this for anybody</font>

47
00:01:43,950 --> 00:01:51,320
who's new to our world now today I

48
00:01:48,090 --> 00:01:53,909
wanted to talk about modifying your

49
00:01:51,319 --> 00:01:56,938
program whatever<font color="#E5E5E5"> training program you're</font>

00:02:02,578 --> 00:02:08,368
program a yoga program which I'm back to

54
00:02:06,060 --> 00:02:10,560
doing once again spending most of my

55
00:02:08,368 --> 00:02:13,090
days doing yoga there need to be

56
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:15,550
modifications to support you

57
00:02:13,090 --> 00:02:17,800
where you are right now the thing<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

58
00:02:15,550 --> 00:02:20,290
that most of the programs we follow are

59
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:22,569
going to be cookie cutter that's just

60
00:02:20,289 --> 00:02:24,280
<font color="#E5E5E5">the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> way it is if</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you're working with a</font>

61
00:02:22,568 --> 00:02:25,719
coach on the other<font color="#E5E5E5"> hand or if you're</font>

62
00:02:24,280 --> 00:02:27,878
working<font color="#E5E5E5"> with a personal trainer or</font>

63
00:02:25,719 --> 00:02:30,549
you're working with a consultant<font color="#E5E5E5"> they</font>

64
00:02:27,878 --> 00:02:31,628
can modify things such that it meets you

65
00:02:30,549 --> 00:02:33,730
right where you're at<font color="#E5E5E5"> but if you're</font>

66
00:02:31,628 --> 00:02:36,280
buying programs online or if you've done

67
00:02:33,729 --> 00:02:38,048
like I've do and you buy DVDs and you

68
00:02:36,280 --> 00:02:39,789
follow<font color="#E5E5E5"> the workouts and things of that</font>

69
00:02:38,049 --> 00:02:42,099
nature you're going to have to know your

70
00:02:39,789 --> 00:02:45,039
body well enough to adjust the

71
00:02:42,098 --> 00:02:47,048
<font color="#E5E5E5">parameters and either add or subtract</font>

72
00:02:45,039 --> 00:02:49,209
things from<font color="#CCCCCC"> that program to support you</font>

73
00:02:47,049 --> 00:02:51,370
where you<font color="#E5E5E5"> are you've got to understand</font>

74
00:02:49,209 --> 00:02:59,500
this following a prescription for

75
00:02:51,370 --> 00:03:01,780
exercise is a prescription for exercise

76
00:02:59,500 --> 00:03:03,818
that's generalized cookie cutter is

77
00:03:01,780 --> 00:03:05,318
great it's going to get you started<font color="#CCCCCC"> but</font>

78
00:03:03,818 --> 00:03:08,828
it's not going to get you<font color="#E5E5E5"> to where you</font>

79
00:03:05,318 --> 00:03:11,229
need to be so in today's blog post I

80
00:03:08,829 --> 00:03:13,360
spoke<font color="#CCCCCC"> about the modifications my uncle</font>

81
00:03:11,229 --> 00:03:14,649
made to my strength training<font color="#E5E5E5"> five by</font>

82
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:17,139
<font color="#E5E5E5">five program back when I was</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> in high</font>

83
00:03:14,650 --> 00:03:18,819
school in order<font color="#E5E5E5"> to correct the amounts</font>

84
00:03:17,139 --> 00:03:23,650
between my prime movers and my

85
00:03:18,818 --> 00:03:28,089
stabilizers particularly particularly my

86
00:03:23,650 --> 00:03:30,579
abdominals my abdominals have had a

87
00:03:28,090 --> 00:03:31,959
tendency to go weak in comparison to my

88
00:03:30,579 --> 00:03:34,180
prime movers this is for a number of

89
00:03:31,959 --> 00:03:36,729
reasons number one my prime movers are

90
00:03:34,180 --> 00:03:39,639
strong as fuck meaning<font color="#CCCCCC"> I've got strong</font>

91
00:03:36,729 --> 00:03:40,988
legs I kind of was born that way I look

92
00:03:39,639 --> 00:03:44,049
at pictures<font color="#CCCCCC"> of myself as a child and I</font>

93
00:03:40,989 --> 00:03:46,209
just<font color="#E5E5E5"> had big legs big strong legs big</font>

94
00:03:44,049 --> 00:03:48,700
strong shoulders I can<font color="#E5E5E5"> move a lot my</font>

95
00:03:46,209 --> 00:03:50,769
back is very<font color="#E5E5E5"> thick but if I don't play</font>

96
00:03:48,699 --> 00:03:53,318
conscious attention to the engagement<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

97
00:03:50,769 --> 00:03:56,109
my deep abdominal wall meaning the

98
00:03:53,318 --> 00:03:58,449
stabilizer muscles in my abdominals the

99
00:03:56,109 --> 00:04:02,739
pelvic floor transversus abdominus and

100
00:03:58,449 --> 00:04:04,959
even the action of my diaphragm my

101
00:04:02,739 --> 00:04:06,879
abdominals will tend to<font color="#E5E5E5"> go limp and weak</font>

102
00:04:04,959 --> 00:04:08,650
and like I said there are a number of

103
00:04:06,879 --> 00:04:10,299
reasons for<font color="#CCCCCC"> that of course there are</font>

104
00:04:08,650 --> 00:04:12,959
four layers of strength so it's not as

105
00:04:10,299 --> 00:04:17,348
simple as my muscles are<font color="#E5E5E5"> just weak it's</font>

106
00:04:12,959 --> 00:04:21,009
also inflammation I<font color="#E5E5E5"> personally have a</font>

107
00:04:17,348 --> 00:04:25,139
tendency<font color="#CCCCCC"> to not digest certain starchy</font>

108
00:04:21,009 --> 00:04:27,589
foods very well<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> just my condition</font>

109
00:04:25,139 --> 00:04:30,090
get into it<font color="#CCCCCC"> now but for a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> very long time</font>

110
00:04:27,589 --> 00:04:31,348
now I've<font color="#E5E5E5"> had a hard time digesting these</font>

111
00:04:30,089 --> 00:04:33,628
types of foods and it causes

112
00:04:31,348 --> 00:04:36,810
inflammation now there's inflammation in

113
00:04:33,629 --> 00:04:39,120
your<font color="#E5E5E5"> gut and I gotta tell you most</font>

114
00:04:36,810 --> 00:04:43,110
people have some form<font color="#E5E5E5"> of inflammation in</font>

115
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:45,899
their gut because we eat a fairly toxic

116
00:04:43,110 --> 00:04:49,379
diet you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> if you're taking protein</font>

117
00:04:45,899 --> 00:04:52,498
shakes and<font color="#CCCCCC"> pretty workouts and all types</font>

118
00:04:49,379 --> 00:04:55,319
of food meal replacements if you're

119
00:04:52,499 --> 00:04:58,409
eating junk food someone on facebook the

120
00:04:55,319 --> 00:05:01,620
other day<font color="#E5E5E5"> asked me why I don't eat a Big</font>

121
00:04:58,408 --> 00:05:02,879
Mac a day in<font color="#E5E5E5"> order to gain muscle what</font>

122
00:05:01,620 --> 00:05:04,620
our<font color="#E5E5E5"> friend doesn't understand is that</font>

123
00:05:02,879 --> 00:05:07,400
it's not<font color="#CCCCCC"> just calories you're ingesting</font>

124
00:05:04,620 --> 00:05:11,189
you're ingesting all the toxic sludge

125
00:05:07,399 --> 00:05:13,560
that comes with a fucking Big Mac right

126
00:05:11,189 --> 00:05:17,699
so your body has to<font color="#CCCCCC"> deal with that and</font>

127
00:05:13,560 --> 00:05:19,949
<font color="#E5E5E5">oftentimes it leads to inflammation so</font>

128
00:05:17,699 --> 00:05:21,810
that's one of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the reasons why I've had</font>

129
00:05:19,949 --> 00:05:24,150
to pay close attention to physiological

130
00:05:21,810 --> 00:05:26,310
strength we should all as well as the

131
00:05:24,149 --> 00:05:30,620
neuromuscular condition of the

132
00:05:26,310 --> 00:05:34,228
abdominals<font color="#CCCCCC"> in the abdominal wall so um</font>

133
00:05:30,620 --> 00:05:36,389
what<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'll share with you are just a few</font>

134
00:05:34,228 --> 00:05:39,258
more ideas that would support you in

135
00:05:36,389 --> 00:05:42,348
<font color="#CCCCCC">developing the core musculature in</font>

136
00:05:39,259 --> 00:05:45,838
conjunction with the squat deadlift

137
00:05:42,348 --> 00:05:48,000
<font color="#CCCCCC">benchpress</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> prime mover exercises that</font>

138
00:05:45,838 --> 00:05:51,598
<font color="#CCCCCC">you do and of course I've already begun</font>

139
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:53,250
down the path of four layers meaning

140
00:05:51,598 --> 00:05:56,088
physiology has to be considered when

141
00:05:53,250 --> 00:05:58,408
you're trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to strengthen key muscles</font>

142
00:05:56,088 --> 00:06:00,810
particularly stabilizers your entire

143
00:05:58,408 --> 00:06:02,129
your entire stabilizer system can be

144
00:06:00,810 --> 00:06:04,500
sure that<font color="#CCCCCC"> I mean stabilizers in your</font>

146
00:06:04,500 --> 00:06:07,379
the foods or the toxins that in your

<font color="#CCCCCC">much linked to physiology the health of</font>

00:06:21,329 --> 00:06:26,038
your organs in fact the only reason why

153
00:06:23,430 --> 00:06:28,439
we have arms and legs and muscles of the

154
00:06:26,038 --> 00:06:31,110
sort is to protect and move the organs

155
00:06:28,439 --> 00:06:33,870
right we crawled up out of the sea so we

that's where we come from and it's where

163
00:06:46,360 --> 00:06:56,259
our focus and vital resources comes from

164
00:06:52,478 --> 00:06:59,288
and should be recharging<font color="#E5E5E5"> I won't get</font>

into the energetic implications I tippy

without giving it a solid lesson on

energetic strength and the chakra system

spoken about it at length on my strength

hippie like you know as it may seem it's

179
00:07:28,209 --> 00:07:35,649
<font color="#CCCCCC">actually very scientific and then as far</font>

180
00:07:33,968 --> 00:07:37,149
as neuromuscular is concerned right

181
00:07:35,649 --> 00:07:38,588
because<font color="#CCCCCC"> that's the most obvious thing</font>

dealing with<font color="#E5E5E5"> the muscular system very</font>

183
00:07:38,588 --> 00:07:42,788
obvious it's right<font color="#E5E5E5"> there you see it you</font>

184
00:07:41,168 --> 00:07:46,448
can touch it right can't touch your

will just<font color="#E5E5E5"> briefly say massaging it with</font>

a small basketball or foam rolling your

217

mobilizing and then stretching the so as

that need to be softened and stretched

226
