00:00:11,939 --> 00:00:16,320
moment I begin<font color="#CCCCCC"> by</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> giving a shout out to</font>

00:00:14,130 --> 00:00:19,050
our friend Nick Bundy who watches these

14
00:00:30,329 --> 00:00:35,939
or is in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the wedding industry somehow</font>

15
00:00:32,729 --> 00:00:37,949
because he makes wedding bands that he

16
00:00:35,939 --> 00:00:39,689
sells on Amazon I know that<font color="#CCCCCC"> sounds crazy</font>

17
00:00:37,950 --> 00:00:44,399
but<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's because they're not dying</font>

18
00:00:39,689 --> 00:00:47,099
encrusted or you know real hard jewelry

19
00:00:44,399 --> 00:00:50,730
in fact<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is what they look like it's</font>

00:00:47,100 --> 00:00:52,289
a rubber<font color="#E5E5E5"> wedding band now I'm married</font>

23
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:58,710

24
00:00:56,460 --> 00:01:00,329
deal with taking<font color="#CCCCCC"> the ring on and off</font>

25
00:00:58,710 --> 00:01:02,489
every<font color="#CCCCCC"> time they're going to pick up</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

26
00:01:00,329 --> 00:01:04,320
barbell and you know it kind of it hurts

27
00:01:02,488 --> 00:01:06,329
your finger or you get chalk all over it

28
00:01:04,319 --> 00:01:07,829
whatever the case may be I always gonna

29
00:01:06,329 --> 00:01:09,840
take my<font color="#CCCCCC"> freakin ring off and it becomes</font>

30
00:01:07,829 --> 00:01:11,879
a bit of a hassle so he figured let me

31
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:14,010
<font color="#E5E5E5">fill the gap in the market place by</font>

32
00:01:11,879 --> 00:01:16,379
creating wedding bands for men who are

00:01:14,010 --> 00:01:19,560
athletic if you lift you might want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

34
00:01:16,379 --> 00:01:22,349
run it run rubber wedding bed anyway he

35
00:01:19,560 --> 00:01:26,000
sent me a package containing several of

36
00:01:22,349 --> 00:01:28,408
these different color rubber bands<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

37
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:30,799
by<font color="#E5E5E5"> the way you can you can find them on</font>

38
00:01:28,409 --> 00:01:35,520
Amazon like<font color="#E5E5E5"> I said just by searching</font>

39
00:01:30,799 --> 00:01:37,140
infinity flex ring but anyway he got<font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font>

40
00:01:35,519 --> 00:01:38,728
got me thinking I got this letter in the

41
00:01:37,140 --> 00:01:41,070
mail yesterday and it got me thinking

42
00:01:38,728 --> 00:01:43,259
<font color="#CCCCCC">about a lot of the risks that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

43
00:01:41,069 --> 00:01:47,069
<font color="#E5E5E5">personally took and many of my friends</font>

44
00:01:43,259 --> 00:01:49,799
who own businesses took when starting

45
00:01:47,069 --> 00:01:51,449
their own thing man because it's quite

46
00:01:49,799 --> 00:01:53,220
risky I mean anything<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you choose</font>

47
00:01:51,450 --> 00:01:55,590
any adventure that you choose to go<font color="#CCCCCC"> on</font>

48
00:01:53,219 --> 00:01:57,090
in life is going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be risky</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> but this</font>

49
00:01:55,590 --> 00:01:59,399
just happens to be one<font color="#CCCCCC"> that some of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> us</font>

50
00:01:57,090 --> 00:02:02,009
choose to throw ourselves into so I

51
00:01:59,399 --> 00:02:06,509
started thinking about how<font color="#E5E5E5"> did I choose</font>

52
00:02:02,009 --> 00:02:08,899
to make the decisions that I engaged in

53
00:02:06,509 --> 00:02:11,699
while I was<font color="#E5E5E5"> taking those seemingly</font>

54
00:02:08,899 --> 00:02:15,120
calculated but also seemingly

55
00:02:11,699 --> 00:02:17,609
blind risks of quitting my job while I'm

56
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:19,019
starting a family and all<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the</font>

57
00:02:17,610 --> 00:02:21,030
different steps that you have to take

58
00:02:19,019 --> 00:02:23,640
investments that you have to make and

59
00:02:21,030 --> 00:02:26,878
all the challenges you face when trying

60
00:02:23,639 --> 00:02:29,068
<font color="#E5E5E5">to turn some nothing into something</font>

61
00:02:26,878 --> 00:02:33,120
right that's what creativity is all

62
00:02:29,068 --> 00:02:35,310
about so I in my blog<font color="#E5E5E5"> post and I wrote</font>

63
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:38,640
it down<font color="#E5E5E5"> here I wrote down my three steps</font>

64
00:02:35,310 --> 00:02:41,370
how to make decisions<font color="#CCCCCC"> about things that</font>

65
00:02:38,639 --> 00:02:44,129
you're not sure about how do you decide

66
00:02:41,370 --> 00:02:47,610
on what to do when you've got a vision

67
00:02:44,129 --> 00:02:49,799
but the path isn't very clear right

68
00:02:47,610 --> 00:02:51,989
oftentimes we're chosen with two paths

69
00:02:49,799 --> 00:02:54,689
right you get out<font color="#E5E5E5"> of high school you</font>

70
00:02:51,989 --> 00:02:57,860
choose well do I go to<font color="#E5E5E5"> the army would I</font>

71
00:02:54,689 --> 00:03:00,780
go<font color="#CCCCCC"> to college you you're dating a girl</font>

72
00:02:57,860 --> 00:03:02,250
do I continue to<font color="#E5E5E5"> date her what do I</font>

73
00:03:00,780 --> 00:03:05,159
break up<font color="#CCCCCC"> with her for</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this one new one</font>

74
00:03:02,250 --> 00:03:07,259
that I like right there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> always these</font>

75
00:03:05,159 --> 00:03:09,810
types of decisions to make and we always

76
00:03:07,259 --> 00:03:13,139
<font color="#E5E5E5">have to go into deep contemplative modes</font>

77
00:03:09,810 --> 00:03:16,469
and engage in activities that associated

78
00:03:13,139 --> 00:03:19,888
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> support us in making decisions so</font>

79
00:03:16,469 --> 00:03:21,419
my three steps number one this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is where</font>

80
00:03:19,889 --> 00:03:22,920
I<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of bullshit myself it's not</font>

81
00:03:21,419 --> 00:03:27,089
completely blind faith because your

82
00:03:22,919 --> 00:03:29,189
<font color="#E5E5E5">first step is to contemplate yes take</font>

83
00:03:27,090 --> 00:03:30,870
<font color="#E5E5E5">the time right away instantly when</font>

84
00:03:29,189 --> 00:03:33,259
you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> not</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> sure what to do the worst</font>

85
00:03:30,870 --> 00:03:37,859
thing you can do is to act spontaneously

86
00:03:33,259 --> 00:03:41,159
in circumstances like this take your

87
00:03:37,859 --> 00:03:42,930
time I say sleep on it<font color="#E5E5E5"> and while you're</font>

88
00:03:41,159 --> 00:03:46,590
<font color="#E5E5E5">sleeping on it while you're gathering</font>

89
00:03:42,930 --> 00:03:52,049
data while you're mulling it over I want

90
00:03:46,590 --> 00:03:56,400
you to consider<font color="#E5E5E5"> this one question what</font>

91
00:03:52,049 --> 00:04:01,849
is the worst that could happen if I

92
00:03:56,400 --> 00:04:04,550
choose a and can I live with<font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font>

93
00:04:01,849 --> 00:04:07,719
and then you ask<font color="#E5E5E5"> yourself the same thing</font>

94
00:04:04,550 --> 00:04:11,090
with decision be what is the worst

95
00:04:07,719 --> 00:04:17,569
absolute worst that could possibly

96
00:04:11,090 --> 00:04:21,410
happen if I choose B and can I live with

97
00:04:17,569 --> 00:04:23,269
it<font color="#E5E5E5"> I remember when I decided to quit</font>

98
00:04:21,410 --> 00:04:25,700
working<font color="#CCCCCC"> at the fitness gym and open my</font>

99
00:04:23,269 --> 00:04:28,250
own why I never<font color="#CCCCCC"> opened shit I opened</font>

100
00:04:25,699 --> 00:04:29,979
like my van the doors to my van and

101
00:04:28,250 --> 00:04:31,819
started training people out in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the park</font>

102
00:04:29,980 --> 00:04:35,240
several years ago when I begin my

103
00:04:31,819 --> 00:04:36,680
business and I'd asked myself what's the

104
00:04:35,240 --> 00:04:39,199
worst that could possibly happen say

105
00:04:36,680 --> 00:04:42,560
nobody signs up for my classes nobody

106
00:04:39,199 --> 00:04:45,349
hires me as a trainer I've got a home

107
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:48,050
and I've got a<font color="#E5E5E5"> wife and I've got a baby</font>

108
00:04:45,350 --> 00:04:49,760
and I've got another child on the way if

109
00:04:48,050 --> 00:04:51,110
this shit doesn't work out once the

110
00:04:49,759 --> 00:04:54,019
absolute worst that could happen<font color="#E5E5E5"> and I</font>

111
00:04:51,110 --> 00:04:56,300
really<font color="#CCCCCC"> thought it over you know and I</font>

112
00:04:54,019 --> 00:04:58,099
really decided that the<font color="#CCCCCC"> absolute worst</font>

113
00:04:56,300 --> 00:05:00,740
that could happen is that nobody hires

114
00:04:58,100 --> 00:05:03,439
me I don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> have any money I will default</font>

115
00:05:00,740 --> 00:05:05,449
on my loans student loans all default on

116
00:05:03,439 --> 00:05:08,689
my credit card loans I'll probably have

117
00:05:05,449 --> 00:05:10,279
to move<font color="#CCCCCC"> my family out of my house the</font>

118
00:05:08,689 --> 00:05:13,610
worst that could happen luckily I have a

119
00:05:10,279 --> 00:05:16,000
little bit of a safety net as most of us

120
00:05:13,610 --> 00:05:19,250
<font color="#E5E5E5">do the worst that could happen is I can</font>

121
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:22,129
send my wife to go live<font color="#CCCCCC"> with her parents</font>

122
00:05:19,250 --> 00:05:25,370
or my parents with my baby while I

123
00:05:22,129 --> 00:05:27,019
continue<font color="#CCCCCC"> to live in my van and make this</font>

124
00:05:25,370 --> 00:05:28,939
shit work because I wasn't going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to give</font>

125
00:05:27,019 --> 00:05:31,519
up no matter what<font color="#E5E5E5"> that was the absolute</font>

126
00:05:28,939 --> 00:05:34,279
worst that could happen in fact along

127
00:05:31,519 --> 00:05:36,319
the way a few other steps intervened

128
00:05:34,279 --> 00:05:39,409
there are a few steps that happened in

129
00:05:36,319 --> 00:05:41,540
between and I had to lean on and people

130
00:05:39,410 --> 00:05:45,290
were there to help<font color="#E5E5E5"> me make</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the thing</font>

131
00:05:41,540 --> 00:05:49,010
happen so it never really fell rock

132
00:05:45,290 --> 00:05:50,660
<font color="#E5E5E5">bottom but</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I set myself up for it I said</font>

133
00:05:49,009 --> 00:05:53,569
what is the absolute worst that<font color="#E5E5E5"> can</font>

134
00:05:50,660 --> 00:05:55,670
happen and I painted<font color="#E5E5E5"> that picture and</font>

135
00:05:53,569 --> 00:05:57,529
asked myself can I live with<font color="#CCCCCC"> that can I</font>

136
00:05:55,670 --> 00:06:01,370
live with my family leaving me to go say

137
00:05:57,529 --> 00:06:04,789
with their family with my parents or her

138
00:06:01,370 --> 00:06:08,629
parents and can I live in my van living

139
00:06:04,790 --> 00:06:11,030
off of rain water and crackers right

140
00:06:08,629 --> 00:06:13,430
that would be the<font color="#CCCCCC"> worst then I get</font>

141
00:06:11,029 --> 00:06:14,619
dysentery and have diarrhea that

142
00:06:13,430 --> 00:06:16,689
dehydrates me and my

143
00:06:14,620 --> 00:06:18,550
eyeballs fall out right that<font color="#E5E5E5"> might</font>

144
00:06:16,689 --> 00:06:23,620
happen it<font color="#E5E5E5"> could happen could you deal</font>

145
00:06:18,550 --> 00:06:26,560
with<font color="#CCCCCC"> it the next step after you've</font>

146
00:06:23,620 --> 00:06:29,079
contemplated and dug deeply into the

147
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:30,819
question whether<font color="#E5E5E5"> or not I could handle</font>

148
00:06:29,079 --> 00:06:33,909
the worst that<font color="#E5E5E5"> could happen you now have</font>

149
00:06:30,819 --> 00:06:38,889
<font color="#CCCCCC">to choose but you choose with a fucking</font>

150
00:06:33,910 --> 00:06:42,220
sword bang right you do this by creating

151
00:06:38,889 --> 00:06:47,139
a deadline for yourself you say all

152
00:06:42,220 --> 00:06:50,229
<font color="#CCCCCC">right this is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> enough tomorrow I choose</font>

153
00:06:47,139 --> 00:06:53,650
and when you choose you put your foot

154
00:06:50,228 --> 00:06:57,009
<font color="#E5E5E5">down you take that axe and you chop off</font>

155
00:06:53,649 --> 00:07:00,189
any other options but the one that you

156
00:06:57,009 --> 00:07:03,099
know you're gonna do and that's it no

157
00:07:00,189 --> 00:07:05,379
turning back that's the key once you

158
00:07:03,100 --> 00:07:09,189
make that decision<font color="#E5E5E5"> the other half of the</font>

159
00:07:05,379 --> 00:07:11,079
decision the other Appa choices the

160
00:07:09,189 --> 00:07:12,850
other things you<font color="#E5E5E5"> could have done you</font>

161
00:07:11,079 --> 00:07:15,430
<font color="#E5E5E5">completely ignore you throw it away you</font>

162
00:07:12,850 --> 00:07:19,120
never turn back and look again because

163
00:07:15,430 --> 00:07:24,269
it'll only make you sick indecisive gray

164
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:30,569
on<font color="#CCCCCC"> the fence and weak you choose hard</font>

165
00:07:24,269 --> 00:07:33,219
that's it they call it burning the boats

166
00:07:30,569 --> 00:07:38,769
there is no back door there's no way

167
00:07:33,220 --> 00:07:41,950
back you jump and then you learn to fly

168
00:07:38,769 --> 00:07:45,939
and that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> the third step the third step</font>

169
00:07:41,949 --> 00:07:47,918
is to make your decision right you burn

170
00:07:45,939 --> 00:07:53,589
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> boats and you make the damn thing</font>

171
00:07:47,918 --> 00:07:55,538
work right you make it<font color="#CCCCCC"> work but</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> there's</font>

172
00:07:53,589 --> 00:07:58,409
a trick to making things work that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'd</font>

173
00:07:55,538 --> 00:08:01,719
like to<font color="#E5E5E5"> share with you a magical</font>

174
00:07:58,410 --> 00:08:04,060
perspective a magic wand that you can

175
00:08:01,720 --> 00:08:07,479
wave over the choices that you've made

176
00:08:04,060 --> 00:08:13,899
in order to make them right every<font color="#E5E5E5"> single</font>

177
00:08:07,478 --> 00:08:15,639
<font color="#E5E5E5">time without fail successful people</font>

178
00:08:13,899 --> 00:08:18,959
don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> make the right decisions they make</font>

179
00:08:15,639 --> 00:08:23,139
their decisions right by always seeing

180
00:08:18,959 --> 00:08:26,199
the silver lining by always<font color="#E5E5E5"> seeing what</font>

181
00:08:23,139 --> 00:08:27,519
they've learned along the way by always

182
00:08:26,199 --> 00:08:32,759
gathering all

183
00:08:27,519 --> 00:08:36,309
of the sometimes intangible<font color="#CCCCCC"> jewels gifts</font>

184
00:08:32,759 --> 00:08:40,750
treasure that you<font color="#E5E5E5"> get when making a</font>

185
00:08:36,309 --> 00:08:42,908
decision and seeing it through so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'll</font>

186
00:08:40,750 --> 00:08:45,339
give you an example a young lady comes

187
00:08:42,908 --> 00:08:47,080
to my gym she moved down from New

188
00:08:45,339 --> 00:08:49,930
Hampshire looking for something new to

189
00:08:47,080 --> 00:08:51,399
do in her life she was very decisive and

190
00:08:49,929 --> 00:08:53,439
decided well I'm gonna<font color="#E5E5E5"> move down</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

191
00:08:51,399 --> 00:08:55,419
Florida I have some family there there's

192
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:56,860
the strength camp gym down there I like

193
00:08:55,419 --> 00:08:58,990
to lift I want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> get involved in</font>

194
00:08:56,860 --> 00:09:00,970
strength sports I'm gonna<font color="#E5E5E5"> make</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> this damn</font>

195
00:08:58,990 --> 00:09:03,339
thing happen along the way I have the

196
00:09:00,970 --> 00:09:05,589
goal of working in a particular industry

197
00:09:03,339 --> 00:09:08,260
this is what her her story isn't it's

198
00:09:05,589 --> 00:09:13,089
what she shared with me and she came

199
00:09:08,259 --> 00:09:15,549
down and things weren't working out the

200
00:09:13,089 --> 00:09:17,140
way she planned right because<font color="#CCCCCC"> this is</font>

201
00:09:15,549 --> 00:09:18,549
the thing about making decisions we make

202
00:09:17,139 --> 00:09:21,100
<font color="#CCCCCC">decisions based on what we think should</font>

203
00:09:18,549 --> 00:09:22,958
happen things weren't working out the

204
00:09:21,100 --> 00:09:25,480
way she had planned<font color="#E5E5E5"> she thought at this</font>

205
00:09:22,958 --> 00:09:27,939
point you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know a few months</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> later she'd</font>

206
00:09:25,480 --> 00:09:29,230
have a career working in an industry but

207
00:09:27,940 --> 00:09:30,790
she loves<font color="#CCCCCC"> she was very clear about what</font>

208
00:09:29,230 --> 00:09:32,680
she wanted but it wasn't working<font color="#CCCCCC"> out</font>

209
00:09:30,789 --> 00:09:34,149
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> way time was running out money is</font>

210
00:09:32,679 --> 00:09:37,389
running out and she's got<font color="#E5E5E5"> to go back</font>

211
00:09:34,149 --> 00:09:40,480
home she<font color="#CCCCCC"> could possibly</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and what most</font>

212
00:09:37,389 --> 00:09:44,708
people would do is see herself as a

213
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:47,709
failure oh woe is me poor me it didn't

214
00:09:44,708 --> 00:09:51,069
<font color="#E5E5E5">work out the way I wanted</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to do but</font>

215
00:09:47,708 --> 00:09:54,129
instead even though she didn't get what

216
00:09:51,070 --> 00:09:56,680
she signed up for she was able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to see</font>

217
00:09:54,129 --> 00:09:59,649
the treasure inherent in making the

218
00:09:56,679 --> 00:10:02,409
decision anyway the fact that<font color="#CCCCCC"> she came</font>

219
00:09:59,649 --> 00:10:04,778
down here gave her space to think about

220
00:10:02,409 --> 00:10:08,199
what she really wants in life it gave

221
00:10:04,778 --> 00:10:11,588
her a few experiences to show her more

222
00:10:08,200 --> 00:10:15,100
of herself she engaged in conversations

223
00:10:11,589 --> 00:10:21,640
with new friends was able to see family

224
00:10:15,100 --> 00:10:25,720
and was<font color="#E5E5E5"> really able to explore a new</font>

225
00:10:21,639 --> 00:10:28,328
realm of life a new way of being put on

226
00:10:25,720 --> 00:10:30,750
a new hat in order to see is this right

227
00:10:28,328 --> 00:10:30,750
for me

228
00:10:32,470 --> 00:10:40,360
and then she adjusted making the

229
00:10:34,990 --> 00:10:43,210
decision right by seeing the silver

230
00:10:40,360 --> 00:10:45,779
<font color="#E5E5E5">lining so that's it my friends those are</font>

231
00:10:43,210 --> 00:10:49,330
the three steps to guarantee success

232
00:10:45,779 --> 00:10:51,850
<font color="#E5E5E5">through buying faith of course you're</font>

233
00:10:49,330 --> 00:10:55,660
thinking<font color="#CCCCCC"> about it do so contemplate</font>

234
00:10:51,850 --> 00:10:57,430
sleep on it number two choose and the

235
00:10:55,659 --> 00:11:01,329
<font color="#E5E5E5">blind faith comes in when you make</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

236
00:10:57,429 --> 00:11:04,919
decision and do that turn your<font color="#E5E5E5"> back burn</font>

237
00:11:01,330 --> 00:11:04,920
fucking boats and go done
