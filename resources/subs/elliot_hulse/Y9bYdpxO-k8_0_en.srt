about<font color="#CCCCCC"> it in a grounded and mature</font>

38
00:01:23,728 --> 00:01:29,819
fashion here is what you have<font color="#CCCCCC"> to do</font>

39
00:01:25,978 --> 00:01:32,759
you've got to say something you can't

<font color="#E5E5E5">time her dad passes by you looked down</font>

50
00:01:51,149 --> 00:01:55,019
<font color="#E5E5E5">and like when you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> go to math class like</font>

51
00:01:53,099 --> 00:01:56,578
the teacher asks you how you're doing

52
00:01:55,019 --> 00:01:58,140
and the whole<font color="#CCCCCC"> thing</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is gonna be so</font>

if<font color="#E5E5E5"> possible I don't know what your</font>

relationship is with with the entire

61
00:02:10,939 --> 00:02:14,449
family but it sounds<font color="#E5E5E5"> like you're a part</font>

62
00:02:12,530 --> 00:02:16,909
of it you need to call a family meeting

63
00:02:14,449 --> 00:02:18,709
I know you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> only 17 I know you're not</font>

64
00:02:16,909 --> 00:02:22,729
a part of their family but they will

65
00:02:18,709 --> 00:02:24,979
respect you and you will develop strong

66
00:02:22,729 --> 00:02:26,869
integrity you'll feel good about

67
00:02:24,979 --> 00:02:29,869
yourself when it's all done when you

68
00:02:26,870 --> 00:02:32,480
<font color="#E5E5E5">bring them around the kitchen table</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

69
00:02:29,870 --> 00:02:35,330
you explain that you know you've been

70
00:02:32,479 --> 00:02:37,098
<font color="#E5E5E5">spending some time you and Sally have</font>

71
00:02:35,330 --> 00:02:38,660

appreciate you<font color="#CCCCCC"> guys I appreciate your</font>

73
00:02:38,659 --> 00:02:43,810
family but right<font color="#E5E5E5"> now in my life I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> feel</font>

74
00:02:41,568 --> 00:02:46,699
like I need to move on to other things

75
00:02:43,810 --> 00:02:48,739
and you say<font color="#CCCCCC"> that oh it's gonna cause you</font>

76
00:02:46,699 --> 00:02:51,289
so much pain it's going to be difficult

77
00:02:48,739 --> 00:02:55,039
but you say that though especially her

78
00:02:51,289 --> 00:02:57,259
parents will respect you more than they

79
00:02:55,039 --> 00:02:59,229
will probably respect any other guy<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

80
00:02:57,259 --> 00:03:02,179
she dates for the rest of her life I

00:03:44,269 --> 00:03:49,700
way like someone<font color="#E5E5E5"> who's becoming a strong</font>

102
00:03:46,909 --> 00:03:51,650
young man you're going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to earn</font>

everyone's respect she's going to be

104
00:03:51,650 --> 00:03:56,060
hurt but her parents are<font color="#E5E5E5"> gonna support</font>

105
00:03:53,239 --> 00:03:58,400
her even more in her getting over the

106
00:03:56,060 --> 00:04:01,729
break up because they realized<font color="#E5E5E5"> that she</font>

112
00:04:13,068 --> 00:04:17,930
that way but that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> what I would say I</font>
