00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,139
so I'm in a nice<font color="#CCCCCC"> restaurant last week</font>

2
00:00:01,889 --> 00:00:08,160
it's me my wife and my four children

3
00:00:04,139 --> 00:00:10,320
I've got three daughters ages 7 23 and

4
00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:12,419
I've got one<font color="#E5E5E5"> and a half year</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> old son so</font>

5
00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:15,359
we slip<font color="#E5E5E5"> into the restaurant of course</font>

6
00:00:12,419 --> 00:00:16,920
<font color="#E5E5E5">people are a little disturbed by the</font>

7
00:00:15,359 --> 00:00:18,689
sight of seeing<font color="#E5E5E5"> all these children come</font>

8
00:00:16,920 --> 00:00:20,279
in but anyway we slip into<font color="#CCCCCC"> a booth we're</font>

9
00:00:18,690 --> 00:00:21,660
<font color="#E5E5E5">sitting down and we're deciding on what</font>

10
00:00:20,278 --> 00:00:27,268
we want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> eat my seven-year-old</font>

11
00:00:21,660 --> 00:00:29,039
daughter starts doing this while she's

12
00:00:27,268 --> 00:00:31,320
in her seat the people next to us

13
00:00:29,039 --> 00:00:33,030
started living us some weird looks and

14
00:00:31,320 --> 00:00:35,909
my wife becomes uncomfortable so I tell

15
00:00:33,030 --> 00:00:38,489
her Kyle relax let her do what she's

16
00:00:35,909 --> 00:00:40,679
doing she's discharging her energy

17
00:00:38,488 --> 00:00:43,109
better that she discharges her energy

18
00:00:40,679 --> 00:00:45,390
than a trapping fuck<font color="#E5E5E5"> what other other</font>

19
00:00:43,109 --> 00:00:48,570
people are thinking her whether<font color="#E5E5E5"> or not</font>

20
00:00:45,390 --> 00:00:51,659
they are disturbed by<font color="#E5E5E5"> the actions of a</font>

21
00:00:48,570 --> 00:00:53,698
seven-year-old<font color="#CCCCCC"> all</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> right not too</font>

22
00:00:51,659 --> 00:00:56,128
<font color="#E5E5E5">concerned she's not really causing</font>

23
00:00:53,698 --> 00:00:58,500
anybody any harm now the thing<font color="#CCCCCC"> is that</font>

24
00:00:56,128 --> 00:01:00,089
<font color="#CCCCCC">she doesn't get that energy</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> out she's</font>

25
00:00:58,500 --> 00:01:02,340
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to end up like most neurotic</font>

26
00:01:00,090 --> 00:01:04,890
adults who are tense and clenched up

27
00:01:02,340 --> 00:01:06,329
don't breathe deep because we're so

28
00:01:04,890 --> 00:01:08,430
worried about<font color="#E5E5E5"> our environment we're so</font>

29
00:01:06,329 --> 00:01:09,599
socialized that we're worried<font color="#CCCCCC"> about what</font>

30
00:01:08,430 --> 00:01:12,150
other people are going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to think about us</font>

31
00:01:09,599 --> 00:01:13,559
so one of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the best ways</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to just get out</font>

32
00:01:12,150 --> 00:01:15,450
all of<font color="#E5E5E5"> that energy that you've got</font>

33
00:01:13,560 --> 00:01:16,769
trapped in you and you know you have it

34
00:01:15,450 --> 00:01:21,560
trapped in you because you've<font color="#E5E5E5"> got tense</font>

35
00:01:16,769 --> 00:01:21,560
muscles right is to do this

36
00:01:30,930 --> 00:01:35,830

37
00:01:33,700 --> 00:01:37,240
