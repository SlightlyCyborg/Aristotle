hey what's up<font color="#E5E5E5"> guys elite</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> halls here and</font>

2
00:00:02,279 --> 00:00:05,580
the problem with most fitness programs

3
00:00:04,049 --> 00:00:07,950
is<font color="#CCCCCC"> that they don't take into account</font>

4
00:00:05,580 --> 00:00:09,480
every aspect of what it is to become the

5
00:00:07,950 --> 00:00:12,900
<font color="#E5E5E5">strongest version yourself and focus</font>

6
00:00:09,480 --> 00:00:16,350
solely<font color="#E5E5E5"> on the body ignoring aspects such</font>

7
00:00:12,900 --> 00:00:19,199
as the mind the soul and life mastery on

8
00:00:16,350 --> 00:00:22,080
the other end most personal development

9
00:00:19,199 --> 00:00:24,449
programs don't take<font color="#E5E5E5"> into account the</font>

10
00:00:22,079 --> 00:00:27,000
<font color="#E5E5E5">body you go to most personal development</font>

11
00:00:24,449 --> 00:00:29,910
seminars and usually you're sitting down

12
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:32,159
<font color="#E5E5E5">having to take notes and listen just</font>

13
00:00:29,910 --> 00:00:34,920
like you did in school and personal

14
00:00:32,159 --> 00:00:36,750
development includes the body but yet

15
00:00:34,920 --> 00:00:38,640
most personal development programs

16
00:00:36,750 --> 00:00:40,320
require that you do the very thing we're

17
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:43,549
trying<font color="#CCCCCC"> to condition ourselves out of</font>

18
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:46,530
which is<font color="#CCCCCC"> to be sedentary week and</font>

19
00:00:43,549 --> 00:00:49,078
unexpressed here at strength camp we

20
00:00:46,530 --> 00:00:50,609
take a holistic approach I have been

21
00:00:49,079 --> 00:00:53,100
making<font color="#CCCCCC"> videos for years talking</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> about</font>

22
00:00:50,609 --> 00:00:54,539
<font color="#CCCCCC">the four layers of strength in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> order to</font>

23
00:00:53,100 --> 00:00:56,850
become<font color="#E5E5E5"> the strongest version of yourself</font>

24
00:00:54,539 --> 00:00:59,250
we take<font color="#E5E5E5"> into account neuro muscular</font>

25
00:00:56,850 --> 00:01:01,890
strength the physical<font color="#E5E5E5"> strength of the</font>

body your posture how you carry yourself

27
00:01:01,890 --> 00:01:08,310
and your physical strength as<font color="#CCCCCC"> well as</font>

28
00:01:05,728 --> 00:01:11,060
physiological strength right because<font color="#CCCCCC"> we</font>

29
00:01:08,310 --> 00:01:13,439
can't separate the rhythms of our life

30
00:01:11,060 --> 00:01:15,329
sleeping and waking cycles call the

31
00:01:13,438 --> 00:01:17,429
circadian rhythm we can't<font color="#E5E5E5"> ignore the</font>

32
00:01:15,329 --> 00:01:19,709
foods that we eat we can<font color="#CCCCCC"> ignore our</font>

33
00:01:17,430 --> 00:01:21,030
hormones in our digestive system if

34
00:01:19,709 --> 00:01:23,609
we're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be the strongest version</font>

35
00:01:21,030 --> 00:01:26,909
of ourselves in the same way we can't

36
00:01:23,609 --> 00:01:30,180
leave out the aspect of the mind I often

37
00:01:26,909 --> 00:01:32,189
talk about how our<font color="#E5E5E5"> body is our mind you</font>

healthier body exercise eat well

41
00:01:37,540 --> 00:01:42,610
and of course becoming a strong aversion

42
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:45,879
to yourself and empowering others is

43
00:01:42,609 --> 00:01:48,219
what<font color="#CCCCCC"> life mastery is all about what good</font>

44
