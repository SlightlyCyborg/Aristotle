6
00:00:17,309 --> 00:00:22,979
tried that and it does make it harder to

7
00:00:19,859 --> 00:00:25,050
the lower back right so how important is

8
00:00:22,980 --> 00:00:26,278
that it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> really important because we</font>

9
00:00:25,050 --> 00:00:29,490
don't want to build imbalances between

10
00:00:26,278 --> 00:00:32,329
the musculature that forces lumbar

extension thoracic<font color="#CCCCCC"> extension and</font>

12
00:00:32,329 --> 00:00:37,109
cervical extension we would like<font color="#E5E5E5"> them to</font>

13
00:00:34,439 --> 00:00:39,030
work together but what ends up happening

14
00:00:37,109 --> 00:00:41,039
is you<font color="#CCCCCC"> don't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> have just mostly goes out</font>

15
00:00:39,030 --> 00:00:42,808
of fashion you've got this shit that

16
00:00:41,039 --> 00:00:48,030
like ties all the muscle together like

17
00:00:42,808 --> 00:00:52,289
saran wrap and you can cheat by having

18
00:00:48,030 --> 00:00:54,510
one group within that fasho within that

19
00:00:52,289 --> 00:00:59,129
loop of<font color="#CCCCCC"> Muslims</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that should be working</font>

20
00:00:54,509 --> 00:01:01,378
together then over works and then gives

21
00:00:59,128 --> 00:01:03,329
the other guys a break you see so we

22
00:01:01,378 --> 00:01:05,518
like<font color="#E5E5E5"> the three musketeers writing using</font>

23
00:01:03,329 --> 00:01:07,618
that term to describe extension and the

24
00:01:05,519 --> 00:01:09,090
three portions of the spine to work in

25
00:01:07,618 --> 00:01:10,950
concert you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know one guy helps the other</font>

26
00:01:09,090 --> 00:01:12,000
<font color="#E5E5E5">guys up there all your dance back and</font>

forth and they're all helping each other

28
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:16,560
but<font color="#E5E5E5"> if you get end up with one guy that</font>

29
00:01:13,819 --> 00:01:18,779
over extends the other guys to be lazy

30
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:20,640

31
00:01:18,780 --> 00:01:22,739
who's going to end up burnt out tired

32
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:23,849
and resentful the other guys just

33
00:01:22,739 --> 00:01:25,618
fucking lazy<font color="#E5E5E5"> someone's time for that</font>

34
00:01:23,849 --> 00:01:31,408

37
00:01:33,868 --> 00:01:39,810
area the jaw neck area becomes very

38
00:01:36,420 --> 00:01:43,890
tense rigid strong and overdeveloped in

39
00:01:39,810 --> 00:01:44,780
most people and that's why the tendency

40
00:01:43,890 --> 00:01:48,019
is to

41
00:01:44,780 --> 00:01:50,599
do this and for a number<font color="#E5E5E5"> of reasons it's</font>

42
00:01:48,019 --> 00:01:52,699
a part of the physical manifestation of

00:01:50,599 --> 00:01:54,859
our<font color="#CCCCCC"> neurosis it causes our own neuroses</font>

44
00:01:52,700 --> 00:01:56,570
it makes it such that the head is almost

45
00:01:54,859 --> 00:01:58,939
<font color="#E5E5E5">cash traded from the rest of the body</font>

46
00:01:56,569 --> 00:02:01,429
the powerful muscles of the jaw on the

47
00:01:58,939 --> 00:02:06,759
neck and the head get very tense in time

48
00:02:01,430 --> 00:02:09,349
we want<font color="#E5E5E5"> almost relaxing and by using</font>

49
00:02:06,759 --> 00:02:15,439
extension and actually trending the

50
00:02:09,349 --> 00:02:18,289
deprogramming here we actually great

51
00:02:15,439 --> 00:02:21,139
bring more balance to the entire neck

52
00:02:18,289 --> 00:02:25,579
that would suggest extensive I spoke

53
00:02:21,139 --> 00:02:28,569
about that video yeah you can<font color="#CCCCCC"> have older</font>
