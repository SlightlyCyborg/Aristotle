1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,339
hey what's up<font color="#E5E5E5"> guys so if you've been</font>

2
00:00:02,069 --> 00:00:08,039
watching my<font color="#CCCCCC"> videos for quite a few weeks</font>

3
00:00:04,339 --> 00:00:11,400
<font color="#E5E5E5">months years or whatever you probably</font>

4
00:00:08,039 --> 00:00:12,869
<font color="#E5E5E5">heard</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> me</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> use certain words over and over</font>

5
00:00:11,400 --> 00:00:15,570
again in one word<font color="#E5E5E5"> that you probably</font>

6
00:00:12,869 --> 00:00:20,129
<font color="#E5E5E5">heard me use most recently in a</font>

7
00:00:15,570 --> 00:00:22,740
repetitive fashion is ritual the reason

8
00:00:20,129 --> 00:00:26,368
why I use the term ritual as a

9
00:00:22,739 --> 00:00:29,759
substitute<font color="#E5E5E5"> for habit is because there's</font>

10
00:00:26,368 --> 00:00:31,320
<font color="#E5E5E5">something a bit more powerful to the</font>

11
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:33,149
rituals in your life whether you know

12
00:00:31,320 --> 00:00:36,509
you're doing<font color="#E5E5E5"> ritual performing rituals</font>

13
00:00:33,149 --> 00:00:39,179
are not if you're cognizant of it and

14
00:00:36,509 --> 00:00:42,000
you can infuse your habits with ritual

15
00:00:39,179 --> 00:00:44,670
power it takes things to another level

16
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:47,730
so what am I<font color="#CCCCCC"> talking about</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

17
00:00:44,670 --> 00:00:49,379
difference between a habit and a ritual

18
00:00:47,729 --> 00:00:50,939
is as simple as looking at<font color="#E5E5E5"> the things</font>

19
00:00:49,378 --> 00:00:52,948
that you do every<font color="#CCCCCC"> day without having to</font>

20
00:00:50,939 --> 00:00:54,448
think about<font color="#E5E5E5"> it habits are things that</font>

21
00:00:52,948 --> 00:00:56,339
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> do without having to think</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> about it</font>

22
00:00:54,448 --> 00:00:58,108
so when you get up in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the morning you</font>

23
00:00:56,340 --> 00:01:00,449
brush your teeth you probably don't

24
00:00:58,109 --> 00:01:03,019
<font color="#CCCCCC">think about it you probably</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> just wake up</font>

25
00:01:00,448 --> 00:01:05,728
<font color="#E5E5E5">get to the bathroom brush your teeth</font>

26
00:01:03,018 --> 00:01:07,890
habits are things that you<font color="#E5E5E5"> have trained</font>

27
00:01:05,728 --> 00:01:10,438
yourself to do or others have trained

28
00:01:07,890 --> 00:01:13,079
you to do without<font color="#CCCCCC"> you having to think</font>

29
00:01:10,438 --> 00:01:14,879
<font color="#CCCCCC">about it it could also be as simple as</font>

30
00:01:13,079 --> 00:01:17,700
getting in your car<font color="#E5E5E5"> right when you get</font>

31
00:01:14,879 --> 00:01:19,379
<font color="#E5E5E5">in your car you've got a motor n-gram</font>

32
00:01:17,700 --> 00:01:21,780
from your head to your hand that

33
00:01:19,379 --> 00:01:23,579
automatically jams at Quillan turns the

34
00:01:21,780 --> 00:01:26,629
ignition that's a simple one<font color="#E5E5E5"> but you</font>

35
00:01:23,579 --> 00:01:29,310
recognize when it's not properly

36
00:01:26,629 --> 00:01:31,560
accessed when you get into<font color="#E5E5E5"> like a new</font>

37
00:01:29,310 --> 00:01:33,350
car right into a new car you have<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

38
00:01:31,560 --> 00:01:35,909
<font color="#E5E5E5">look for the keyhole so on and so forth</font>

39
00:01:33,349 --> 00:01:39,239
so it goes from being something that

40
00:01:35,909 --> 00:01:41,159
<font color="#E5E5E5">some novel and new that's something that</font>

41
00:01:39,239 --> 00:01:44,060
becomes habit habitual you just do<font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font>

42
00:01:41,159 --> 00:01:49,640
over and over again it becomes<font color="#CCCCCC"> a ritual</font>

43
00:01:44,060 --> 00:01:53,219
when you infuse it with conscious power

44
00:01:49,640 --> 00:01:56,250
so some things<font color="#CCCCCC"> that well you can</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> really</font>

45
00:01:53,219 --> 00:01:58,968
you can really infuse anything with

46
00:01:56,250 --> 00:02:03,569
conscious power and make it a ritual

47
00:01:58,968 --> 00:02:05,099
things as simple as being completely

48
00:02:03,569 --> 00:02:07,889
focused

49
00:02:05,099 --> 00:02:10,079
and present with your meal when you're

50
00:02:07,890 --> 00:02:12,599
<font color="#E5E5E5">eating a lot of people set the stage</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> by</font>

51
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:16,350
or set the tone by saying a prayer of

52
00:02:12,599 --> 00:02:18,120
gratitude or grace before they eat this

53
00:02:16,349 --> 00:02:19,530
turns you're eating this turns your

54
00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:21,180
habits of eating most people eat

55
00:02:19,530 --> 00:02:22,560
completely unconsciously<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know we</font>

56
00:02:21,180 --> 00:02:24,750
just we're just<font color="#E5E5E5"> stuff including our</font>

00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:27,479
<font color="#CCCCCC">mouths driving eating fast food and shit</font>

58
00:02:24,750 --> 00:02:31,259
<font color="#E5E5E5">but if you pause for a moment just pause</font>

59
00:02:27,479 --> 00:02:34,049
for<font color="#CCCCCC"> a moment and offer 10 seconds of</font>

nourishment that you're about to get

66
00:02:43,919 --> 00:02:50,280
your meal becomes a ritual the powerful

67
00:02:48,269 --> 00:02:53,700
thing about being fully fully present

68
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:56,568
and concentrating all your mental and

69
00:02:53,699 --> 00:02:59,669
spiritual effort on an activity<font color="#CCCCCC"> like</font>

70
00:02:56,568 --> 00:03:05,099
eating or any other mundane activity is

71
00:02:59,669 --> 00:03:07,639
that you become more<font color="#E5E5E5"> fully aligned with</font>

72
00:03:05,099 --> 00:03:07,639
the

73
00:03:10,759 --> 00:03:16,280
energy is available<font color="#E5E5E5"> from the activity it</font>

74
00:03:13,789 --> 00:03:18,229
goes from being a rote activity to

75
00:03:16,280 --> 00:03:20,060
something that<font color="#E5E5E5"> produces more</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> than just</font>

76
00:03:18,229 --> 00:03:23,378
like when you<font color="#E5E5E5"> eat it produces more than</font>

77
00:03:20,060 --> 00:03:26,658
<font color="#E5E5E5">just nutrition for your body but it in</font>

78
00:03:23,378 --> 00:03:27,649
live-ins your spirit right when you put

79
00:03:26,658 --> 00:03:30,139
<font color="#E5E5E5">that food in your mouth and you're</font>

80
00:03:27,650 --> 00:03:32,269
thinking<font color="#E5E5E5"> about the gratitude you're</font>

81
00:03:30,139 --> 00:03:34,250
holding gratitude with you while you're

82
00:03:32,269 --> 00:03:37,400
eating that food or you're drinking that

83
00:03:34,250 --> 00:03:39,560
water you've turned that simple act into

84
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:42,530
a spiritual act you turn something from

85
00:03:39,560 --> 00:03:45,620
profane into sacred a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of these ideas</font>

86
00:03:42,530 --> 00:03:48,530
<font color="#E5E5E5">come from a book in fact called sacred</font>

87
00:03:45,620 --> 00:03:51,650
and profane by<font color="#E5E5E5"> Mercer le a day if you're</font>

88
00:03:48,530 --> 00:03:53,000
interested in<font color="#E5E5E5"> these types of ideas so</font>

89
00:03:51,650 --> 00:03:55,400
look at your<font color="#E5E5E5"> life look at when you're</font>

90
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:58,479
making love to<font color="#E5E5E5"> your woman for example I</font>

91
00:03:55,400 --> 00:04:02,060
mean there's an entire practice

92
00:03:58,479 --> 00:04:04,669
associated with bringing spirituality

93
00:04:02,060 --> 00:04:08,259
bringing focus and concentration turning

94
00:04:04,669 --> 00:04:11,208
your sexual act turning your lovemaking

95
00:04:08,259 --> 00:04:13,399
into art turning<font color="#E5E5E5"> into prayer turning</font>

96
00:04:11,209 --> 00:04:16,519
into spirituality they call this Tantra

97
00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:18,108
so you know a lot of people<font color="#CCCCCC"> there their</font>

98
00:04:16,519 --> 00:04:19,759
relationships<font color="#CCCCCC"> go pretty boring</font>

99
00:04:18,108 --> 00:04:21,709
especially their sexual relationships

100
00:04:19,759 --> 00:04:23,360
get pretty boring because you know sex

101
00:04:21,709 --> 00:04:25,668
becomes a habit you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know every</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> night or</font>

102
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:27,379
every other night or whatever<font color="#E5E5E5"> your habit</font>

103
00:04:25,668 --> 00:04:31,459
is it's like you know you go and you

104
00:04:27,379 --> 00:04:35,389
poke<font color="#CCCCCC"> your girl what I'm inviting you to</font>

105
00:04:31,459 --> 00:04:40,009
consider is to turn your love<font color="#CCCCCC"> Act into</font>

106
00:04:35,389 --> 00:04:42,019
an act of prayer by ritual izing it so

107
00:04:40,009 --> 00:04:46,759
you would do things like<font color="#CCCCCC"> perhaps light</font>

108
00:04:42,019 --> 00:04:49,129
candles turn on music clean the sheets

109
00:04:46,759 --> 00:04:51,019
take a shower these are all ways to

110
00:04:49,129 --> 00:04:53,269
<font color="#CCCCCC">prepare your mind prepare your spirit</font>

111
00:04:51,019 --> 00:04:55,009
and prepare<font color="#E5E5E5"> your body for the thing</font>

112
00:04:53,269 --> 00:04:57,948
<font color="#E5E5E5">you're about to do you're gonna go make</font>

113
00:04:55,009 --> 00:04:59,449
love man we<font color="#E5E5E5"> want to be fully present we</font>

114
00:04:57,949 --> 00:05:00,860
want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> get the most out of it we want</font>

115
00:04:59,449 --> 00:05:04,129
<font color="#E5E5E5">the experience to transform us not just</font>

116
00:05:00,860 --> 00:05:05,300
our body right we bust a nut but

117
00:05:04,129 --> 00:05:08,000
actually to<font color="#E5E5E5"> walk away feeling</font>

118
00:05:05,300 --> 00:05:09,620
invigorated enlivened like you've added

119
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,908
something to the world you've added

120
00:05:09,620 --> 00:05:13,399
something to<font color="#CCCCCC"> yourself and you've</font>

121
00:05:10,908 --> 00:05:15,288
contributed to the to the blossoming of

122
00:05:13,399 --> 00:05:16,629
your woman's energy when you make love

123
00:05:15,288 --> 00:05:22,000
to her

124
00:05:16,629 --> 00:05:24,769
and of course everyday things that we do

125
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:28,069
can be ritualized and infused with

126
00:05:24,769 --> 00:05:30,379
spiritual power just by being conscious

127
00:05:28,069 --> 00:05:33,199
of it so I remember when I was in high

128
00:05:30,379 --> 00:05:35,420
school and I was never really<font color="#E5E5E5"> a good</font>

129
00:05:33,199 --> 00:05:38,120
student but I was a really good athlete

130
00:05:35,420 --> 00:05:40,100
I love strength<font color="#E5E5E5"> training and I took good</font>

131
00:05:38,120 --> 00:05:42,439
care of my body it became the<font color="#E5E5E5"> thing that</font>

132
00:05:40,100 --> 00:05:43,850
<font color="#E5E5E5">I centered all my discipline around you</font>

133
00:05:42,439 --> 00:05:46,219
know school was<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of the thing that I</font>

134
00:05:43,850 --> 00:05:48,200
had to do training<font color="#CCCCCC"> and taking</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> care of my</font>

135
00:05:46,220 --> 00:05:50,300
body is<font color="#E5E5E5"> the thing I wanted to do but I</font>

136
00:05:48,199 --> 00:05:53,659
started doing really well in<font color="#E5E5E5"> school when</font>

137
00:05:50,300 --> 00:05:55,910
I began ritual izing the healthful

138
00:05:53,660 --> 00:05:57,460
practices associated with studying and

139
00:05:55,910 --> 00:05:59,870
doing my homework what do I mean by that

140
00:05:57,459 --> 00:06:03,829
before I would engage in my<font color="#E5E5E5"> homework</font>

141
00:05:59,870 --> 00:06:08,420
practice I would ritualistically go into

142
00:06:03,829 --> 00:06:11,990
my kitchen fill up a big cup of ice fill

143
00:06:08,420 --> 00:06:16,490
it up with water set it by my next to my

144
00:06:11,990 --> 00:06:21,530
books I lay everything out take a few

145
00:06:16,490 --> 00:06:23,720
breaths and the begin working I didn't

00:06:21,529 --> 00:06:25,759
<font color="#E5E5E5">know what I was</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> doing at the time</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> but I</font>

147
00:06:23,720 --> 00:06:28,400
quickly realized that<font color="#CCCCCC"> uh that I started</font>

148
00:06:25,759 --> 00:06:31,129
falling<font color="#E5E5E5"> out of good patterns when I</font>

149
00:06:28,399 --> 00:06:32,929
stopped filling up my health full glass

150
00:06:31,129 --> 00:06:35,839
of<font color="#CCCCCC"> water might help full cup of water</font>

151
00:06:32,930 --> 00:06:37,040
<font color="#E5E5E5">and doing a deep breathing taking a deep</font>

152
00:06:35,839 --> 00:06:39,439
breathing moment before doing my

153
00:06:37,040 --> 00:06:41,180
homework I hated homework but because I

154
00:06:39,439 --> 00:06:43,850
ritualized that I was able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to get myself</font>

155
00:06:41,180 --> 00:06:45,889
into the flow into the energy into the

156
00:06:43,850 --> 00:06:50,770
frequency of getting that<font color="#E5E5E5"> thing done and</font>

157
00:06:45,889 --> 00:06:50,769
enjoying it letting it be come a gift

158
00:06:52,300 --> 00:07:00,348
so so of course we can turn our entire

159
00:06:55,968 --> 00:07:05,569
lives into a sacred experience we can

160
00:07:00,348 --> 00:07:07,610
turn our every profane moment into a

161
00:07:05,569 --> 00:07:10,399
ritual we can turn everything that we do

162
00:07:07,610 --> 00:07:14,149
which seems mundane boring and wrote

163
00:07:10,399 --> 00:07:16,579
into an act of<font color="#CCCCCC"> Prayer if we infuse it</font>

164
00:07:14,149 --> 00:07:23,598
with our full consciousness intention

165
00:07:16,579 --> 00:07:26,778
and love a<font color="#CCCCCC"> Japanese</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> tea party or tea</font>

166
00:07:23,598 --> 00:07:29,928
ceremony which I had the luck though

167
00:07:26,778 --> 00:07:32,478
that the the joy of participating in in

168
00:07:29,928 --> 00:07:34,788
fact my daughters<font color="#CCCCCC"> and wife</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we're in</font>

169
00:07:32,478 --> 00:07:37,488

170
00:07:34,788 --> 00:07:39,468
party<font color="#E5E5E5"> an English tea party interesting</font>

171
00:07:37,488 --> 00:07:41,868
that the east and<font color="#E5E5E5"> west both have</font>

172
00:07:39,468 --> 00:07:44,088
versions of a tea party which require

173
00:07:41,869 --> 00:07:45,679
now to the<font color="#E5E5E5"> tea party ain't just tea</font>

174
00:07:44,088 --> 00:07:48,139
party if you've been<font color="#CCCCCC"> to Japan</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> or England</font>

175
00:07:45,678 --> 00:07:49,549
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> AHS we sit sitting down and pouring</font>

176
00:07:48,139 --> 00:07:52,689
some tea at least you know the

177
00:07:49,550 --> 00:07:57,829
experiences I've had and traditionally

178
00:07:52,689 --> 00:08:00,289
it's a big<font color="#E5E5E5"> to-do I mean every with a</font>

179
00:07:57,829 --> 00:08:03,259

181
00:08:03,259 --> 00:08:08,538
cup how you pour<font color="#CCCCCC"> the thing how you toast</font>

182
00:08:06,379 --> 00:08:10,968
it how you sip it the whole fucking

183
00:08:08,538 --> 00:08:15,639
thing is infused with full consciousness

184
00:08:10,968 --> 00:08:20,149
it's like a prayer in motion like yoga

185
00:08:15,639 --> 00:08:22,489
tea parties brushing your teeth eating

186
00:08:20,149 --> 00:08:28,129
your meals and making love<font color="#E5E5E5"> to your woman</font>

00:08:32,958 --> 00:08:37,518
of ritual
